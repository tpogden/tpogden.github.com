<p>Me and Olivia spent a few days in Croatia, mostly eating seafood, drinking
Pošip and swimming in the Adriatic.</p>

<p>A regular ferry will drop you on the forested island of Lokrum. The Austrian
archduke <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I_of_Mexico">Maximillian</a> had
a holiday home here but got bored so declared himself Emperor of Mexico. Shortly
after he was captured and executed by the Mexican government. Think I
would&rsquo;ve stuck with Lokrum.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a botanical garden on the island and a lot of crickets that
will sometimes land on you.</p>

<p>Wandering the old town is a joy but in August it's best in the early
morning before the temperature gets up and before the cruise ships arrive.</p>

<p>A few minutes on a cable car takes you to the top of Mount Srđ, where
Napoleon Bonaparte built a fort during the short French rule over the city.
There is an exhibition on the small group who defended the old fort during the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Dubrovnik">siege of Dubrovnik</a> 
in 1991.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re visiting Dubrovnik the thing I&rsquo;d recommend the most is
the
<a href="ttp://www.warphotoltd.com/">War Photo Limited</a> gallery set up by New
Zealand photojournalist Wade Goddard.</p>

<blockquote>
It is the intent of War Photo Limited to educate the public in the field of war
photography, to expose the myth of war and the intoxication of war, to let
people see war as it is, raw, venal, frightening, by focusing on how war
inflicts injustices on innocents and combatants alike.
