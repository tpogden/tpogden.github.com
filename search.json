    "text": "Travelling Light\nIn figure 1 you see an example simulation1 of a short pulse of light of a single frequency travelling through space. We’ll label the space axis z and the time axis t.\n\n\n\n\nFig 1 — Propagation of a weak Gaussian pulse through space. The distance unit is arbitrary.\n\n\n\nIt travels on unimpeded according to the homogenous Maxwell wave equation\n \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial z^2} - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2\nE}{\\partial z^2} = 0 \nat the speed of light in vacuo, c. Light is an electromagnetic wave and here E is the magnitude of the electric field.\nIn figure 2, we have the same pulse of light travelling over the same space, but this time it moves through a cloud of atoms indicated by the blue area between z = 0 and z = 1. Now the right hand side of the wave equation is nonzero.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2 — Gaussian pulse propagation through a cloud of two-level atoms. The time unit is the inverse spontaneous decay width of the transition. The green indicator line marks c, the speed of light in vacuo.\n\n\n\nThe light is monochromatic and resonant with a level transition in the atoms. As the light pulse enters the atom cloud, the photons it’s made up of hit atoms and excite their electrons into the higher energy levels so that the energy of the light pulse is gradually absorbed and scattered. As it leaves the back of the atom cloud, the peak carries on with a constant but weaker peak intensity, about 50% of what it started with.\nThere’s something more interesting that happens in the simulation though. The speed of light c in this system is marked by the green line moving along with the pulse. That’s the speed that the peak of the pulse moved in figure 1. If you look closely at the pulse as it reaches the end of the atom cloud, you’ll see something odd. The peak of the pulse travelling through the atoms is ahead of the pulse that went through vacuum. It’s light that has arrived faster than light.\nThe difference is hard to pick out I admit, so to make it clearer in figure 3 we have the photo finish at the end of the atom cloud.\n\n\n\n\nFig 3 — Reversed time profiles of the results in figures 1 and 2 (shown blue and green respectively) at the z = 1 space point. The profiles are both normalised to a peak of 1 for comparison.\n\n\n\nThe blue pulse is the one from figure 1 and the green pulse is the one from figure 2. I’ve coloured them different to distinguish them here, but don’t take that to mean anything different about the light – it’s the same monochromatic pulse going in. You can see that here at the end of the medium, the centre of the pulse travelling through the atoms has advanced ahead of the vacuum pulse by about 10% of the initial pulse width.2\nHow do we square this with the causality requirement that nothing travels faster than light? Can this simulation be physical?"

    "section": "Phase Velocity and Group Velocity",
    "text": "Phase Velocity and Group Velocity\nTo understand how this faster-than-light or superluminal propagation works, we’ll start with the concept of phase velocity. Take a monochromatic beam of light incident on some atoms. The light will induce dipoles on these atoms causing them to radiate a secondary wave at the same frequency. That it’s the same frequency is important here. The resultant superposition of the incoming and secondary waves then has the same frequency but a different phase. If this resultant wave lags the incoming wave an observer downstream has to wait longer to see the peaks of the resultant wave go by. The wave will appear to have slowed. This is what we mean by phase velocity, v_p. The outgoing phase velocity depends on the incoming frequency, which is how a raindrop is able to split the colours of sunlight in a rainbow. We call that dispersion.\nWe relate the phase velocity to the speed of light in a vacuum by v_p = \\frac{c}{n} where n is the refractive index of the material (the atoms in our case) and is a function of the frequency \\omega. In figure 4 we see the refractive index for the atoms in the simulation above around the resonance transition.\n\n\n\n\nFig 4 — Real refractive index vs. frequency around resonance on the atomic transition.\n\n\n\nThe effect on the light as it moves through these atoms depends on its frequency relative to the resonance. To the left we’re driving the atoms below their resonance frequency, n &gt; 1 and the resultant wave lags the incoming wave. To the right we’re driving the atoms above their resonance frequency, n &lt; 1 and the resultant wave leads the incoming wave. This is all classical physics as we’re driving the atoms with a weak field so each atom can be modelled well as a driven, damped harmonic oscillator.\nNow the envelope of the narrow pulse of light on resonance is equivalent to a superposition of waves across a wide range of frequencies,3 each of which as we’ve seen will have a different v_p according to where they are on the refractive index function in figure 4. The peak of the pulse is the position where the component frequencies are all in phase and this moves at a speed we call group velocity, v_g. Similarly we define a group index n_g such that v_g = \\frac{c}{n_g}. We can derive that this group index is given by\n\nv_g = n + \\omega \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}.\n\nYou can see that the second term is proportional to the gradient of the refractive index profile. If this is negative and large it is possible for v_g &gt; c. For our system we see in figure 4 that the gradient is negative in a narrow region around the resonance. We call this a region of anomalous dispersion.\nHow fast can we make the group velocity? The first thing we might think of to make it faster is to increase the atom number density to allow more induced dipoles to disperse the phase velocities. This does work, but there are a couple of drawbacks. First, the region of anomalous dispersion around resonance is also the region in which the atoms absorb the most energy from the field so the peak is significantly reduced. That’s OK to a point though, if we care just about the arrival time of the pulse and not its height. Second, and more significant, is the effect dispersion has on the shape of the pulse. See in figure 3 how the pulse developed a negative tail? Eventually the pulse breaks up and it no longer makes sense to talk about a single pulse. There’s a way to fix this though.\nIn the top part of figure 5 we see again the refractive index from figure 4. The red area indicates the region of anomalous dispersion, where the gradient \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\omega} is negative. In fact, when I’ve been talking about the refractive index so far I’ve actually meant the real part of the refractive index, which is a complex quantity. The imaginary part is related to the absorption of light at a given frequency and is shown in purple. It’s a Lorentzian lineshape just like we see in absorption spectra.\n\n\n\n\nFig 5 (Top) — Real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index vs. frequency around resonance on the atomic transition. The region of anomalous dispersion is indicated by the red area. (Bottom) — Input Gaussian pulses of widths t_w = 1 and t_w = 10 transformed into the frequency domain.\n\n\n\nIn the bottom part of figure 5 we see in blue the input pulse from figure 2, Fourier transformed into the frequency domain. You can see what I mean when I said above that the pulse envelope is equivalent to a superposition across a wide range of frequencies. And in this plot we see why we are able to get superluminal propagation in this pulse – it covers the region of anomalous dispersion.\nNot all of the pulse is in the anomalous dispersion region however.4 The low and high frequency wings of the pulse head out into the regions where \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}\\omega} is positive. That means that these components of the field are going to move slower and the pulse shape is going to be distorted. This is the cause of the negative tail of the pulse in figure 2. If we could get all of the pulse into the anomalous dispersion region, we could reduce this dispersion of the pulse. And we can!\nTo get a narrower pulse in the frequency domain, we need a wider pulse in the time domain. The green pulse in the bottom part of figure 5 is one we’ve made 10× longer in the time domain and we see in the frequency domain it is all tucked in a narrow region around resonance. Moreover, the gradient of the refractive index is nearly constant for all components, so we should see less dispersion.\nIn figure 6 we see the photo finish like in figure 3 but for the wider pulse, with and without the atom cloud.\n\n\n\n\nFig 6 — Reversed time profiles of the results with no atoms and the atom cloud (shown blue and green respectively) at the z = 1 space point for longer pulses (t_w = 10). The profiles are both normalised to a peak of 1 for comparison.\n\n\n\nThis time we see that the pulse holds its shape and at the same time we’re able to get pulse advancement of about 30% of the pulse width. This is light travelling significantly faster than c. Figure 7 shows the pulse advancement of a series of simulations with varying pulse width and number density.\n\n\n\n\nFig 7 — Pulse advancement vs. number density for the narrow pulses (t_w = 1) and wider pulses (t_w = 10).\n\n\n\nThe blue dots indicate simulations done with the narrower pulses and the green dots indicate simulations done with the wider pulses. The relationship between number density and pulse advancement is close to linear. The highest pulse advancement I reached in these simulations is nearly 50% of the pulse width. The limiting factor is the increasing absorption such that I end up with a pulse so small I start hitting numerical limits in the simulation."

    "text": "Experimental Observation\nAll I’ve shown you so far is mathematics and the results of numerical simulations. The possibility of faster-than-light travel is a big claim. You might well be asking if it has ever been achieved in experiment. It has! As far back as this Physical Review Letters paper by S. Chu et al.5 in 1982. In that case they achieved pulse advancement but found large absorption, for reasons explained above. Later, the ability to avoid that absorption was realised in this Nature paper by L. J. Wang, A. Kuzmich & A. Dogariu in 2000. It’s worth quoting a bit of the abstract:\n\nEinstein’s theory of special relativity and the principle of causality imply that the speed of any moving object cannot exceed that of light in a vacuum (c). Nevertheless, there exist various proposals for observing faster-than-c propagation of light pulses, using anomalous dispersion near an absorption line, nonlinear and linear gain lines, or tunnelling barriers. However, in all previous experimental demonstrations, the light pulses experienced either very large absorption or severe reshaping, resulting in controversies over the interpretation. Here we use gain-assisted linear anomalous dispersion to demonstrate superluminal light propagation in atomic caesium gas. The group velocity of a laser pulse in this region exceeds c and can even become negative, while the shape of the pulse is preserved.\n\nI particularly like this figure from a 2006 paper in Science by Gehring et al., because you can see it looks like my figure 3 above with pulse advancement and a dispersed negative tail (their time axis is the other way around so flip the image in your head).\n\n\n\n\nFig 8 — Pulse advancement vs. number density for the narrow pulses (t_w = 1) and wider pulses (t_w = 10).\n\n\n\nAnd while I was working on my PhD in Durham, my fellow student James Keaveney and colleagues in an experiment using a nano-cell achieved the largest negative group index ever measured."

    "text": "Information Velocity\nAt this point, you might be wondering why the authors above published papers on superluminal propagation rather than using it to make themselves incredibly rich. Maybe you’ve read Flash Boys, the best-selling book on high-frequency trading by Michael Lewis, and recall the story of the person who dug a straight-line tunnel for optical fibre through mountains between the exchanges of New York to Chicago to reduce the transmission time from 17 to 13 milliseconds. Traders handed over millions to access this small increase in speed. If I’m giving you instructions on how to make light travel faster than the speed of light, can’t I use that to beat the traders? You probably already guessed the answer is no.\nIn the case of fast light, the group velocity v_g is not the same as the velocity of information carried by the pulse. The reason is subtle, but remember that our wave envelope is made up of individual components travelling at a speed c, even if their phase is shifted. The peak of the pulse is just where we see the phases of those components line up, and there is no causal link between the peak of the output pulse and the peak of the input pulse. We can’t send information faster than c, even in superluminal propagation. Which is probably reassuring. I recommend this PRL paper by Kuzmich et al. (arXiv) if you want to read more about information velocity and causality in fast light."

    "text": "Day 1: Edale to Crowden\nSo this was it then. I woke up on the sofa-bed at my old house in Manchester, with a bellyful of nervousness and a slight funk in the head from a cheap bottle of Bordeaux I’d swigged on Friday evening. ‘Have I prepared enough for this?’, ‘Will my dodgy knee give up after a couple of hours?’ and ‘Will everyone think I’m a twit when I have to admit I couldn’t do it?’ were all doubts stirring while I fished a teabag from my morning brew.\n\n‘You’re walking to Scotland? No bus fare?’\n\nEdale, the starting point of the Pennine Way, is handily located on the Hope Valley railway line between Manchester and Sheffield, and I’d been quite looking forward to that little journey to begin my walk. The train was delayed by some violent-looking types who—from what I could hear over the reassuring Guided By Voices in my headphones—were flatly refusing to buy any tickets. I think the inspector gave up in the end. Gorton, Romiley and Chinley all flew by, I hauled my rucksack off and up to the Old Nag’s Head Inn and put the compass lanyard around my neck.\n\n‘Did they set alarm clocks for early morning trouble-causing? That’s dedication to the art.’\n\nA couple of other parties were getting themselves together as I set off, and I quickly passed a group of sweet-looking girls on the first path and, feeling brave by now, gave them each a smile and ‘Good morning!’. Soon I was climbing Jacob’s Ladder up to Kinder Scout (A), and the soft, green hills and day-walkers of the southern Peak District were promptly replaced by the fiercer, lonely Dark Peak.\nThe guide2 recounts this section as a ‘lunar terrain of gritty pebbles and bare black peat.’ The rusty patches of moss made me think ‘martian’ a better descriptive. Not that I’ve been to Mars recently. Once past Kinder Downfall I was into my first proper wilderness stretching out to to Snake Pass (B).\nAs I paused by the side of the road for sandwiches and a swig from my hipflask, a chap coming the other way stopped briefly for a chat. He’d been up checking out one of the WWII aircraft wrecks lost up there in the mist.\nThe route up through Devil’s Dike to Bleaklow (C) was as cheerful as these sobriquets suggested3: walls of peat leaned over me, hailstones pinged off my cheeks and the path became an indistinct stream bed which forked unnervingly. I didn’t hang around at the windy summit and followed the steep edge round and eventually down to Torside Reservoir. All that was left was to pass through the calm wood on the other side and watch some sheep headbutting each other before finishing the day at Crowden.\n\n\n6.50 — Single train fare from Manchester Piccadilly to Edale."

As this second leg was due to end close to Rochdale and my family home, and it being a weekend, my dad had kindly decided to join me for the day and I was looking forward to his company.\n\n‘The map says this should be a bridlepath. Is this a bridlepath?’‘Would you bring a horse up here?’ ‘I don’t think so. I hate horses.’\n\nThe morning was frosty, sunny and clear, which is pretty much perfect for long-distance trekking, though we had to watch for slippery ice patches. We began with a steepish climb up to Laddow Rocks, which offered a good view back over Bleaklow and the previous afternoon. From there we continued along to Black Hill (A). The column at the top is named ‘Solider’s Lump’, after the Royal Engineers who surveyed this vast boggy expanse in the 19th century—I can imagine it was a miserable undertaking. Before the path to it was paved, says the guide, ‘more than one reckless adventurer had to be rescued after getting stuck fast’ trying to reach it. Heavy stone slabs made it a bit easier for us, so we stopped for some tea from dad’s flask and a couple of biscuits.\nThe descent down to the Wessenden reservoirs on the other side afforded views over Holmfirth, Marsden and Huddersfield. Grouse Butts was an abrupt jump up to a long stomp over Black Moss and Rocher Moss, by which time we were both feeling a bit of fatigue. After six hours, we stopped at Standedge (B) to lunch on sandwiches and finish off the tea, using the large boulders as a windbreak. The view is south-west over Oldham to Manchester. Having first seen the city (now easier to spot at distance thanks to the Beetham Tower) from the south at the summit of Kinder Scout, viewing it from the north gave me some impression of how far I’d already walked. My pained feet confirmed.\nThe trudge along the edge and to White Hill felt very long indeed, but eventually we made our way down to the footbridge over the M62 motorway (C). Knowing this high crossing from the many times I’ve driven underneath it, I had been oddly excited about walking over it. It’s very noisy.\nBlackstone Edge, above Hollingworth Lake, was our final ascent of the day. My mum and dad had taken us up here one sunny afternoon, maybe thirteen years before. Curiously, when we got up among the huge dark boulders I could remember the Liverpool away shirt I’d worn that day, and that my cousin Sam had been with us hopping over the rocks. We scrambled down to the White House pub where mum collected us in her car. Being so near home, I got to go back for platefuls of lasagne and a gloriously hot bath.\n\n\n2 — Sore ankles."

    "text": "Day 3: Blackstone Edge to Ponden\nAfter a comfortable evening at mum and dad’s house on Sunday evening, I said ‘bye’ and set off again early on Monday. The first two days could’ve just been a nice weekend’s hiking not too far from home; for the next fortnight I’d be on my own.\n\n‘Now I’ve worked out how to limp on both feet, I’ve just got to keep this up for the next eight hours.’\n\nThe start contrasted harshly with the morning before: drizzle replaced sunshine, solitude replaced chatting with dad and my heels and shoulders hurt already. I naïvely set off with my sleeping bag strapped to the rucksack, rather than inside it, and when it fell off for the second time I realised that it was already soaked.\nLight Hazzles and Warland Reservoirs felt sinister as I walked along their edges, with the fog obscuring my view any further than the black water’s edge. Wet high voltage power lines crackled loudly. Following along the drain I saw a figure appear out of the cloud right in front of me: a young chap who, under his dark hood, seemed to be as glad to see another person as I was. ‘The whole thing?’ he asked? ‘I’m doing it in sections now. I’ve tried it all the way twice but didn’t make it. Once everything gets wet, it’s over.’ I glumly considered the sopping sleeping bag and tent on my back, and wondered how waterproof the backpack itself was.\nI continued towards Mankinholes and up to Stoodley Pike (A) along a path I’d taken on a circular walk with my dad a few weeks before. I was calmed a bit by the familiarity. The Pike is a monument to peace built after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. Usually visible for miles around, I almost walked into the 38m-tall black obelisk in the blanket fog. I struggled to make out its top, staring up in the wind, and again felt very uncomfortable. There’s a spiral staircase inside which allows one to climb up in the blackness, but the idea did not appeal so I quickly set off down towards Callis Wood. Obviously, I didn’t have time to stop by lovely Hebden Bridge (enclave of tolerance and creativity among northern mill towns) and began the precipitous climb up from the valley floor at Callis Bridge (B). Heptonstall Church—where Sylvia Plath was buried—came into view soon after along the next valley.\nAfter a long, dispiriting moor slog I dropped to a meeting of two streams at Graining Water (C) and sat in the small space of grass, sheltered from wind, to eat some lunch. Concerned about progress, I didn’t stop long before heaving my bag up past another large reservoir and then beginning another slow moor climb up to Withens Height and another literary landmark on the other side.\nThe ruined farmhouse of Top Withens (D) was the inspiration for Wuthering Heights in Emily Brontë’s cracker. It’s certainly isolated enough. My feet were as sore as Heathcliff, so I could think only of finishing for the day. I finally found Ponden House and paid to pitch my tent down by a stream on the old grounds of Ponden Hall, where the young Brontës would come to play and read in the library. This was literature day, then. I peeled off my socks, full of blood, and tried to clean up my blisters. I think I was a little delirious with exhaustion, as I remember forcing myself to eat some cold cheese and bread before I crawled into my damp sleeping bag at about seven o’clock. I put the Radio 4 In Our Time podcast on my headphones, and drifted through three or four episodes without listening before I fell into fitful sleep.\n\n\n2 — Dead poets."

Some pissy rain made putting the tent down a pain and then I remembered I had no chance of hot food or even a tea. Gah. I’d set off from Blackstone Edge with the wrong gas canister for my stove, and foolishly thought it might be easy to pick one up along the way. I was currently two miles from the nearest anything and that was in the wrong direction. I ate my last banana and read the guide’s prediction for the morning: ‘a grey day’ of ‘moors and mires’. Best get going then.\nPonden being nothing but a few farm houses, I was quickly out onto bare hills again, and striding out toward Wolf Stones (A). Thankfully the wildlife is a bit tamer now than it was back in the 16th Century.4\nWhen I dropped down into Cowling, I became concerned because I had already drunk one of my flasks of water, was still feeling very thirsty and had most of the leg ahead of me.\nTo make things worse, I dropped my one full flask as I tried to unscrew it. Idiot! I checked each driveway on the way out of the village for an outdoor tap, without success.5\nGaining altitude over another couple of hills, I gave it up again easily into Lothersdale (B). There the guide and Ordnance Survey both promised a Post Office, which I thought might sell me a bottle of Volvic or a Lucozade; on arrival I was informed that it’d been closed. The day had begun to brighten just as noon passed, and I was glad of assistance from a man out trimming his hedge. He filled my water bottles up for me and I gulped away my thirst.\nI got a bit lost in some farmer’s fields on the approach to Thornton-in-Craven (C), which is always irritating. I only ever notice when I get to the edge of a field and realise there’s no stile so I must shuffle all the sodding way back. However, I was still making reasonable time so I stopped by the side of a lane to eat some biscuits and nuts—all I had left to eat by then. I switched my phone on to check for messages and Livy happened to be on her lunch break so she called me. It was lovely to hear her voice, and this brief chat turned out to be my watershed in mood—everything picked up from here on and I soon reached the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Easy to follow and flat (obviously), I could admire barges and take in the afternoon sunshine.\nGargrave felt like the promised land on arrival. Not only did I spy two pubs—it had a Co-op! After finding a campsite, I set off in search of hot vegetarian food. The Mason’s Arms obliged with a cannelloni. It probably wasn’t that great but, being my first warm meal in two days, it tasted wonderful. I washed it down with pints of water and bitter, charged my phone and listened to stories from the bar stools.\n\n‘…and she went off with that bloke, what’s his name? He came back from laying pipelines in Arabia.’ ‘Oh, you mean Pipeline Pete?’ ‘No not Pipeline Pete, the other one…’\n\nI stopped by the Co-op on the way back to stock up on plasters, bread and fruit, and also found a pack of doughnuts reduced to 35p. I ate the lot for dessert, and climbed contentedly into my tent.\n\n5 — Jam doughnuts eaten."

I had a worryingly deep hole in my right heel, and blisters on my blisters. I’ll spare you more detail. Thus, I had decided to take an afternoon off on Wednesday to keep them clean, dry and rested.\nKnowing that a shorter, flatter, sunnier walk awaited me, I felt a zillion times cheerier than the morning before. I quickly reached the River Aire for a tranquil waterside stroll. Baby lambs bounced about as I meandered through their meadows—that sort of thing. I passed Airton and the big, renovated farmhouses of Hanlith, and approached the famed destination of Malham at noon. I found Town Head Farm to camp with splendid views of Malham Cove, and remarked to myself on the number of hand-written, laminated signs around the place.\n\n‘No smoking. Switch lights off. Pay before pitching. Do not leave taps running. No fires. No camping beyond this sign. No noise between 11pm and 6am….’\n\nI need not have feared all these regulations, as I received a friendly welcome. The camping shop had recently closed so there was nowhere to buy gas, the lady explained, and kindly brought me out a cup of tea—my first in three days! I rinsed my socks in the sink and hung them out on barbed-wire to dry. Further bylaws were posted through the afternoon; I kept checking to make sure I remained a law-abiding, lone camper.\n\n‘What network are you on? If you stand in the middle of the main road a bit up from here you can get O2… if you’re tall enough.’\n\nEngland were playing football later on, so I wandered down to a pub to watch it. Finding it hard to stay awake I left soon after half-time, ready to scale the limestone cliffs of the Cove in the morning.\n\n73 — Campsite directives."

    "text": "Day 6: Malham to Horton-in-Ribblesdale\nA lovely morning. I was up soon after dawn, and had my sights on the white crescent of Malham Cove to the north. Just one thing puzzled me: where were the baguettes I’d kept for breakfast? I thought back to the night: I’d woken with a jolt… a push on the tent and a rustled bag… silence…. Fox! The thieving critter must’ve got a paw under the tent and nabbed my petit déj. Ah well, I had some fizzy Lucozade to get me going.\nI scrambled up and arced along the crown of limestone pavement to joyfully admire the view back. Nobody else up and walking yet, and not a nimbus or cirrus in sight. The path led across tough grass to Malham Tarn (A), a pretty lake with a grand house on the far side, which the guide informed me had been built by Lord Ribblesdale in the late 18th century as a shooting lodge. I bet the foxes stayed away from his breakfast.\nAround the shore past the house, I rose again into open moorland, and hiked up an old miner’s track to lonesome Fountain’s Fell (B). Maintaining my high spirits, I sang Jonathan Richman over and over—sheep scarpering as I called ‘whaddyasay about that, you guys?’ at them like a lunatic. Pen-y-ghent stood imposingly on the other side of the valley. After descending and crossing the road to its southern base, the unswerving incline dared me to take it on.\nThe shelf which casts Pen-y-ghent’s distinctive profile provided a brief breather in the vertiginous climb, though I was unusually full of energy. Once over the stile at the summit (C) the steep track actually led away from Horton, but promised to bring me there the long way round. I found a farm to camp at but no farmer, despite the alert of barking dogs. I eventually spied him at the back of a large shed full of sheep. I never understand what’s going in these buildings, so I stood tentatively in the light of the doorway.\n\n‘Hello! Here to camp are you? Come down that alley in the middle. That’s it, all the way down. I’ve got a ewe lambing here, and she isn’t going to stop for you I’m afraid.’\n\nThe Pen-y-ghent café further up the road looked cozy, so I stopped in for a sandwich and a tin of ginger beer. And there I saw it. Up on the shelf, among a few assorted bits of kit: a gas canister, and unmistakably the model I wanted! After six days, I’d found my fuel. I signed their Pennine Way guestbook (only the second name of 2009) and headed excitedly back to my tent. I pulled out the stove, army tin and couscous I’d been carrying and boiled myself up some dinner. Cooking on gas. Friendly farmer Sutcliffe walked over to enquire how the day’s walking had gone, and where I was off to on the Friday.\nI’d been out of phone reception for a couple of days, so I walked back up to the red phonebox to update the folks on progress. I stopped in the Crown Inn for a pint of Black Sheep and quietly observed a village council meeting around the biggest table. I didn’t stay long before calling it a night.\n\n\n\n\n625 — ’Radio on’s."

    "text": "Day 7: Horton-in-Ribblesdale to Hardraw Force\nUp and packing to leave soon after six o’clock on Friday, I was somewhat disheartened to find thick mist outside the zipper. What happened to the clear skies of Thursday? I shook as much water as I could from the outer tent and heaved up my bag to go. The friendly farmer waved ‘bye’ from a distance across the field, where I surmised he was off to do something farmy in his wellingtons. I shuffled quietly through the village, past the Inn I’d visited the night before.\nA stone-walled path carried me gently out of Ribblesdale, and to my delight I suddenly broke through the ceiling of fog, which I now saw blanketed only the sleeping valley. Above this, I strode in fresh, warm daylight; the disc of the sun rising quickly from behind Pen-y-ghent’s peak. I could hardly contain the bliss of being such a pretty moment, so quiet and early in the day. I suddenly felt strong and young. That is to say, impossibly fortunate. Such reflections are rarer than they really should be. It was certainly a feeling I wanted to savour; one that made it worth all effort expended.\nApart from the distant summits, including Ingleborough—the other giant of the area—the views changed little as I progressed through the morning. One or two shadowy holes suggested locations of the caves indicated on the map. Past Cave Hill (there’s a clue), I arrived at the head of a deep cut in the limestone, Ling Gill (A). Ancient ash trees (and other old species I don’t know the names of) lined the sides of the gorge, steep enough to offer protection from nibbling animals.\n\n‘Anno 1765 thys bridge was repaired at the charge of the whole of West Rydeing.’\n\nThe track met the Cam High Road, a well-trodden Roman route over Cam Fell (B). I gained height gradually, overlooking a vast conifer plantation stretching out to the east, before turning left onto a packhorse trail along the edge of a rounded valley. This was one of those sections I underestimated from the map; it took much longer than I expected to reach the highest point, Ten End. From here, however, the view opened out to Wensleydale and more alluring Dales villages.\nI eventually dropped down and across a few flat fields into Gayle. The Way enters this hamlet via an ugly pebble-dashed housing estate—something of a shock after a day of walking in open country. It quickly leads on to the larger market town of Hawes, where I dropped my bag briefly for a rest. I was beginning to boil in the afternoon sun. I circled the wonky streets forming the centre of the town, looking for somewhere to find supplies in between the many touristy craft shops. I had to pick up some local cheese in Wensleydale, of course. Once stocked up, I set off toward the day’s destination: the Green Dragon Inn in Hardraw. This pub has Britain’s highest waterfall, Hardraw Force, in its back garden, which I thought would make it a pleasant place to rest for the night.\nI was tired and hungry by the time I got there and set my tent up, and rather churlishly admonished the barman when he told me there was no hot water to wash in. I do still think a fiver is a bit much to charge for a patch of grass if you’re not even going to provide a hot water tap. A bath under the falls perhaps? This was where Kevin Costner took a dip for that scene in Robin Hood, so perhaps not out of the question! Other patrons may not have approved. Anyway, I thought the landlord was ‘monetising’ that waterfall a bit much. Apparently it’s two pounds just to have a look at it. It can’t exactly take much maintenance.\nThe Force is certainly impressive though: a 30m single drop. After checking it out and enjoying my cheese with some bread, I settled down for a late nap. In the evening I went back into the pub to find a cozy seat next to the fire. I spent a while chatting to a sweet couple from St. Helens who were out on their motorbike for the weekend. He wore a Pantera t-shirt and merrily described adventures he’d had on his bike; she seemed genuinely excited about camping ‘for the first time’. I was starting to get used to it. As it was £3.60 for a pint of bitter (in Yorkshire!) I didn’t ask for a second, returning instead to my tent to sip on whisky and listen to the rumbling falls.\n\n\n\n\n6.67 — Waterfall price per metre."

So I cursed when I woke to patters on the tent not long after five o’clock. I had a plan in the event of a wet start, however. I’d spotted a house-build next to the inn, which had been topped off but not fitted with windows or doors yet. I got all my stuff together inside the tent (quite difficult when everything has to be done lying down) and ran my bag over to drop it in the house. Then I ran back, circled the tent to pull out all the pegs and carried it over so I could take it down and sort my waterproofs out under the protection of a roof.\nThe morning’s task was Great Shunner Fell (A) and, boy, was I shunned by this mountain. The rain continued to pour, the cloud pressed in on me as soon as I got onto the Fell and the wind only got fiercer as I gained altitude. The outside world disappeared entirely and I had no idea how far I’d gone or had to go. My nifty backpack-covering waterproof poncho only served, in these conditions, as a sail to push me in whichever direction the gales swirled, and to flap up into my face; so I gave up on it, preferring to get soaked. It took no little determination to keep going for hour after hour like this; I repeated ‘HUP! two, three, four…’ continuously to maintain a pace, and shouted crazily at myself to keep going.\nThe summit cairn offered little protection from the elements and no views, of course, so I continued, northeastward, for more of the same on the descent. As I neared Thwaite (B) and a return to civilisation, I finally passed somebody: a southbound Pennine Way walker. He’d taken eleven days to get to this point, which worried me a little as I only had eight days to cover the same ground. It’s curious to meet someone coming the other way—you each hold the whole trail in your head: part in memory, part in imagination; but you each have the opposite parts. Your near future is their recent past, and vice versa. You try to extract information through questions, ‘what are the best and worst bits to come?’, ‘what’s the Cheviot like?’ and by examining faces for signs of joy, tiredness or fear when they answer.\nPerhaps the strain of Great Shunner showed in mine, because before we carried on, he said ‘you know, if you take a left on the first road you get to down there, it’ll take you straight to Keld and chop a couple of miles off.’ As a measure of my weariness, I began to consider the idea. Reaching the road, I paused for a moment and compared the directness of the tarmac with the hike over Kisdon Hill. I carried on—no shortcuts! I soon wondered if I’d regret that decision however, as I got lost on the side of Kisdon. Finding myself at a dry stone wall with no stile, I realised I was a few contour lines away from where I needed to be, and so had to track back for a miserable twenty minutes. On the right path again, I journeyed down through woodland and over some ankle-testing scree, before stopping for lunch next to a river crossing at a small waterfall, where the Pennine Way bisects Wainwright’s Coast-to-Coast walk (C).\nHere I had to say a fond farewell to the Dales as I entered County Durham. After an ascent back onto open moorland, I spotted my destination: the implausibly isolated Tan Hill Inn. Tan Hill is the highest pub in England at 528m above sea level, right on top of a remote moor. I had expected it to be somewhat quiet (with the significant effort required to get here from anywhere) but when I arrived, in the afternoon, it was full. I waited at the bar as the man I presumed to be the landlord served drinks. He was a cheery, middle-aged chap with spiky hair (dyed bright red), a black wasitcoat and missing front teeth. A bowler hat later appeared. From the way he bantered with the customers, I think he’d typically be described as ‘a character’. I approved of his swagger in time to the country music on the jukebox. I asked if I could camp. ‘Of course you can,’ he exclaimed, and even kindly offered me a couch to sleep on indoors in the bar lounge. Lovely! ‘The only thing is, this is a wedding party, and it’s likely to keep going late into the night.’ The girls next to me confirmed enthusiastically. So that would be why there were so many smartly-dressed folk then.\nI had to consider my options. As much as a comfortable couch in a warm room appealed, I knew I’d be exhausted and would want to be away early in the morning. I didn’t really want to get involved with a wedding. I thanked him and went to set up my tent outside. For the second time in a day, I wondered if I’d made the right call. Being on top of a broad summit, the wind made pitching a tent (even a low one like mine) difficult. At first I looked for the best bit of ground, but the wind just bent the poles flat there. With very little grace I staggered with the tent across to the biggest boulder I could see to use it as a break. Unfortunately, the ground here was at an incline, and was bumpy with stones. What choice did I have? I pitched as near to the boulder as I could stamp the pegs in, and weighed all the sides down with rocks to stop gusts from getting underneath.\nI scurried back into the pub to sit down and get warm, and worried about my tent outside. ‘You’ll be fine’ said the barman, nodding to the wind speed meter above the optics. ‘32 miles an hour. We get 50 to 60 here sometimes.’ I was less than reassured, and spent the evening wondering if my tent would get to Kirk Yetholm a few days before me. I’d taken up residence next to the fire to read and, as nobody seemed to be paying any attention, I poked and stoked it a couple of times to keep it burning. Only when I stood up to check on my stuff did I realise my work had constituted an acceptance of responsibility.\n\n‘Where do you think you’re going? You’re in charge of that fire now, son—you’d better be keeping an eye on it.’\n\nSo then I had a tent and a fire to worry about.\n\n\n\n\n14 — Tent fail windspeed in metres per second."

    "text": "Day 9: Tan Hill to Middleton-in-Teesdale\nSlumped at the bottom of my tent due to the slope, and by then overfamiliar with each of the stones that pressed through the groundsheet, I wondered if it was worth getting up yet. My phone must’ve picked up some signal, as I found a text from my friend Jim: ‘will be at a66 at 8, half eight.’ Where was the A66? Why had he written out the second ‘eight’? Never mind, he was on his way! Jim had kindly offered to join me for couple of days’ walking, and I was really looking forward to having someone other than myself to talk to. Jim’s always fun to have around.\nThe A66, Ordnance Survey informed me, was about 11km from where my tent was perched upon Tan Hill, so I had to get moving. I struggled to hook out the pegs as my fingers were quickly numbed by the wind. I wanted to move quickly down Sleightholme Moor—to warm myself up and not to leave Jim waiting in a trunk road lay by—but it wasn’t so easy. The guide warned that it ‘can be a dangerous place’, and offered an alternative road route, but I was keen to stick to the official trail and visibility was good enough. The danger, I discovered, lay in tracts of waterlogged peat, into which it’s quite possible to sink deep with a misplaced step. There was little clear path to follow and where I did find it, it was trodden into murky puddles. I set a compass bearing and held it as best as I could.\nI made reasonable time, and found myself on the path down to God’s bridge, where a brook disappears under a huge slab of limestone before reappearing again unhindered. And nearby, by the road (A), Jim had just arrived. I showed him where we were headed on the map and we set off vaguely north across Bowes Moor.\nThe trail met and shadowed a dry stone wall for a long while and, not having to study the compass so much, I prattled on—I hadn’t held an extended conversation with anyone for a week!—and Jim updated me on his York City’s chances of survival in the conference. Reaching the brow at Race Yate Rigg, we then stomped down Cotherstone Moor (the guide puts it perhaps a bit harshly: ‘a sweep of featureless waste’. I thought it was alright) to the gap between Blackton Reservoir (B) and the colossal dam wall of Balderhead Reservoir.\nFrom there we rose uphill through some high, scruffy meadows to a ridge from where we could see out next port of call, Lunedale, and another pair of reservoirs. Passing over the bridge between these, we trekked up through a couple of farms and their scattered barns, to the higher ground around Harter Fell (C). The eerie circle copse of Kirkcarrion, a Bronze Age burial site, stole our attention at the top of the hill to the East.\nWe finally traipsed onto the road into Middleton at about three o’clock. Having already decided that we should drop our bags soon and scout for a Sunday lunch, we stopped at the first campsite we met on the edge of town. It featured rows of those dreary green static caravans, but offered a space for tents. Looking for a reception, I ventured into the campsite bar/clubroom, which obviously hadn’t been decorated this side of 1990. I waited for a youngster in a Sunderland shirt to swap his coins for Monster Munch before paying to to pitch Jim’s tent: a two or three-manner which seemed palatial compared to the coffin-sized thing I’d been getting used to.\nWe left quickly to see if we could find somewhere still serving lunch. A couple of pubs had finished up, but the 1618 café held out for us. Though not offering a veggie alternative for the lunch, they were very accommodating and fixed me up a mushroom bake to go with the spuds and vegetables. While we waited, we read the wonderfully local stories in the pages of the Mercury—‘voice of Teesdale since 1854’— whose office sat opposite the café.\nOnce fed, we wandered over to the Bridge Inn to play a few games of pool. A young mechanic and his girlfriend sat silently next to the window. Sunday in a small town. After pool and a game of darts, we set off back to the tent to read up on Monday’s leg, which would be a serious 30km trek. I took the opportunity to enjoy my first shower in three days. Bliss.\n\n\n\n\n3 — Bathtubs in Fields."

    "text": "Day 10: Middleton-in-Teesdale to Dufton\nDespite one or two protests from Jim, and an initial refusal to vacate his sleeping bag, we folded up the tent and set off reasonably early. The day promised a scenic riverside mosey and visits to the famous waterfalls of Low and High Force; the latter holding the title of biggest waterfall in England by volume6. This section comprised the dogleg of the Pennine Way trail; for a whole day we’d be walking west, rather than making any direct progress north toward my destination in Scotland.\nI was a bit concerned to discover, when stumbling out of the tent, that the knee-ouch I’d suffered towards the end of Sunday’s leg had not gone away as I’d hoped. By this point, I’d had several spells of pain in a hip, ankle or foot, but had walked each of them off. This one seemed more persistent, very sore and, moreover, coincided with an injury I’d received playing football a few months prior. I could hardly put any weight on my right leg without a stab in the outer side of the joint. ‘How can I keep walking on this?’ I felt sick at the thought of not finishing after I’d made it all this way. I gulped a couple of Ibuprofen tablets down (the first I’d used so far) and set off with a bit of a hobble. At least the morning’s terrain, accompanying the meanders of the River Tees, would be relatively undemanding.\nThe first part actually cut off a couple of the windier turns of the river, heading through pastures and over stiles. Soon we were on the river bank again under a canopy of trees. Massive white bags of pavement littered the path for a distance, ready to be laid soon. In their current position though, they were obstacles around which we had to weave and squeeze. Thankfully, the painkillers were now working, dulling the sharp discomfort to a more tolerable ache.\nThe three cascades of Low Force announced the start of a dramatic stretch of rapids and whirlpools. As we continued excitedly up toward High Force (A), the path teasingly took us away from the river, returning just at the south bank viewing point for the falls. It is a spectacular plunge over the dark slab of Whin Sill7. We paused for a drink.\nAs the roar quietened behind us, the Way left soft pastures for heath and higher ground. The Tees veered off to the right as we went over a small hillock. It came back to meet us again and we crossed over a footbridge near to Forest-in-Teesdale—the only habitation visible in the opening panorama. As is not unusal for us, Jim and I got on to discussing the brilliance of Half Man Half Biscuit and soon discovered that theirs made for great walking songs. Thus, much of our day hoofing it through remote wilderness was soundtracked by shouts of ‘They’ve got a German Shepherd dog called Prince, the one called Sheba died…’ and so on.\nFalcon Clints required some arduous scrambling over cliffs as we met the Whin Sill up close. It took almost an hour to cover what looked like a short distance on the map. ‘Twisted ankles and broken hips are regular mishaps on this section,’ warned the Guide. We eventually turned the corner to Cauldron Snout (B), another crashing cascade just below the dam of the Cow Green reservoir.\nThe trail then passes for a distance along the edge of Warcop, a vast MoD firing range. There are signs near the path warning ‘Keep out or we might shoot you’ (or words to that effect). We childishly creeped off the path a little to see if we could spot anything, but nothing seemed to be going down. Perhaps they were having a day off, or else they were all disguised as rocks.\nWe left the Tees at the reservoir to follow its tributary Maize Beck, and were soon walking out over a featureless expanse between distant Fells. This sort of stretch can be draining. We had to cross the Beck at a footbridge, but Jim decided to hop across rocks in the shallow water. After that, he began to lag behind me. This was the second longest leg I would complete in the fortnight, and he’d only been walking for one day so I certainly sympathised. I remembered how much I’d been suffering on the second and third days up to Blackstone Edge and Ponden, and realised I’d built up some stamina in the past week of full-time walking.\nNow into the afternoon, I thought we’d just have a prolonged slog into Dufton to go but Jim pointed out that ahead was an impressive-sounding feature I’d missed in the Guide: High Cup. The astonishing view that greeted us at High Cup Nick (C) was one of the highlights of the whole Pennine Way. I now realised why we’d spent a day walking west, away from the eventual destination: this was breathtaking! High Cup is an immense, broad and perfectly symmetrical glacial valley, with the cliff of the Whin Sill forming a vertical rim. Due to the way the Way brought us to the top ‘nick’ of the valley, the view was an utter surprise as the landscape suddenly disappeared from below us. We stood at the edge trying to take in the scale and throwing stones off to vanish toward the distant valley floor.\nAfter this rest, we followed around the north edge of the valley, still admiring the views, for a lengthy descent into Dufton. Jim had decided that he wasn’t ready for a third day’s walking on Tuesday—quite reasonably, especially as it would include the Pennines’ highest Fells—and so was intent on finding some way of returning to York that evening. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the British railway network, he realised that nearby Appleby-in-Westmorland was a stop on the Settle–Carlisle railway, which would connect.\nWe’d hoped to enjoy a pint in the Stag Inn before he left, but on arrival it was mournfully closed. Possibly as it was a Monday; Dufton is not a real place. At the same time, checking the train times and spotting an ‘Appleby 3½’ sign, we realised he didn’t have long to get there before the last train. And just to improve matters, it started raining. Off he ran.\nI found the (empty) campsite to set up my tent, and quickly got everything inside. Miserably, there was nothing for me to do in Dufton but lie in my tent listening to the rain. Oh well, at least I could boil up some hot food and make a cup of tea… except, stupidly, I’d allowed my matches to get damp. I could not get a single one in the pack to light. Bah! And then my tent began to leak right above me. Wonderful. I put my army tin under the drip, opened a packet of biscuits and sipped on whisky.\nI received a message from Jim at around 8 o’clock.\n\n‘Not one single bloody lift! Did a double time jog to Appleby in rain then up bloody big hill to get to station with 2min before last train. Now speeding back through Dales…’\n\nI was glad, and not a little amazed, that Jim had made his train home. I had a bit further to go yet.\n\n\n\n\n38 — Soggy Matches."

    "text": "Day 11: Dufton to Alston\nRain was not what I wanted for the hike over the fells to Alston but I’d been fortunate with weather this far so I couldn’t protest much. I pointlessly tried to shake some of the water off my tent and got going.\nThe route skirted west of the steep, conical Dufton Pike and soon left the calm pastures of the Eden Valley for more forbidding Pennine heights. I knew I was to take on the biggest of the lot today, and that this was not the weather for it. Well, I’d slogged in rain before and could slog again.\nThe first ascent was Knock Old Man (A), at 794m. This is a significant climb from the valley floor. Just as on Shunner Fell, I lost all visibility as soon as I’d gained a bit of altitude and the wind picked up. Unable to use landmarks, I was perpetually checking my map and compass. The path was not obvious and, suddenly, it disappeared entirely. I had imagined some vague marks into a pattern, which vanished like a mirage. I searched around, and decided to track back on my bearing. I found a fork I’d missed in the fog, indicated by what in ordinary conditions would’ve been a prominent rock, with an arrow pointing right where I’d gone left.\nTaking greater care now, I made my way to the Knock summit. The force of the wind encouraged me off again quickly. Reaching the bottom of the dip before the next climb, I stumbled across tarmac. This was very peculiar—why was there a metalled road so high up? The Guide informed me that it is, in fact, the highest road in Britain and that it heads up to the Radar Station on top of Great Dun Fell (B), at 848m. This conspicuously huge white ‘golf ball’, along with assorted masts and small buildings, watches air traffic over the North Atlantic, and would purportedly lead me to the summit: ‘No one will ever get lost trying to find Great Dun Fell in anything short of white out conditions.’ I suppose this was ‘white out’ then, because I couldn’t see a thing. The path was navigable, however, and I met the facility’s perimeter fence over which, right in front of me, was a huge white sphere I couldn’t make out the edges of. I shivered in the wind, and in the alienness and isolation of the place.\nI carried on quickly to Little Dun Fell next door, only a jot littler at 842m. It is more of a ridge connecting its neighbour and Cross Fell. The side wind hit me even harder here, and I had to crouch into it. I spotted a small stone shelter and decided I’d run to it for a breather before the final push. As I slumped back on my rucksack, I turned to find a sheep’s skull on the rock inches from my face—as if it wasn’t unnerving enough up here. Just one more.\nIf I’d studied the topography of Cross Fell (C), I probably wouldn’t have got myself into trouble. The top was in fact a plateau, about 1km wide and nearly 2km long at a maximum height of 893m. As I was now a little tired, I didn’t scale it properly from the map. It had a brim of scree, which had to be scrambled up. At this point, several routes split but all seemed to lead to a tall cairn at the top. The wind up here—on the very top of the Pennines—was incredible. I could only open the map page in the miniscule shelter the cairn offered, and set off on the West Northwest bearing to find the summit marker.\nThere was no path at all. I kept checking for the obelisk behind me but it soon disappeared. It felt wrong—no markers and no foot erosion at all. I tracked back and found the tall cairn again. I reset my bearing and zigzagged a little to search for a trail. No sign. I stopped again to think, and realised I was getting very cold. I only wore a t-shirt and breathable jacket while walking so I would often get chilly if I stopped, but in this gale, soaked through, I was going to freeze if I didn’t keep moving.\nThen, out of the fog, I saw a new cairn to the left. I headed straight to it. It was stupid of me not to check the bearing I was taking. It turned out to be just a pile of scree, and led nowhere. Now I was lost. It took most of my energy just to restrain from panic. ‘Keep calm and think.’ I decided I’d keep west, find the edge of the plateau and follow it north, where it had to meet the path to descend on the north face. Though not the easiest or most direct of routes, it would surely get me there. I strode with my head down into the howling wind and beating rain, checking each step to avoid turning an ankle on a rock or in a hole. There were still pockets of snow up there. I manically repeated, ‘Where’s the path? Where’s the path? There’s got to be a path.’ I had been up there a long time and was shivering, lost, slightly terrified and very alone.\nThough poorly cited when I write, the Wikipedia article on Cross Fell gives some idea of it not being the most comfortable of places:\n\n‘The fell is prone to dense hill fog and fierce winds. A shrieking noise induced by the Helm Wind is a characteristic of the locality. It can be an inhospitable place for much of the year. In ancient times it was known as “Fiends Fell” and believed to be the haunt of evil spirits.’\n\nFinally, I found something. It was eroded only slightly, but had to be heading the right way. ‘Path. Path. Path…’ I murmured senselessly. Then it was gone again. But by now I was heading down the north side of the hill (forget the summit marker, I wanted off), and I knew I had to meet a miner’s track crossing perpendicular. I hit it. Just to the right I saw an isolated dwelling through the fog; it had to be Greg’s Hut, marked on the map as an emergency shelter for anybody stranded up there. Relief! Joy! I knew where I was, and I was safe.\nI thought about sitting in the hut for a bit, but after sheltering behind it for long enough to get my breath back, I decided to march on. It would all be downhill from there. After half an hour or so I met three southbound Pennine Way walkers, the first people I’d seen all day. I was very glad of it. They were in good spirits, and one was even wearing sunglasses in the rain, which may have had something to do with him being Australian; I wasn’t sure. I told them to be careful, and described my fright up on the fells, but they didn’t seem to be taking me seriously. Perhaps they found their way over just fine.\nI can’t remember much of the rest of the afternoon; Cross Fell kept going through my head. My trousers were frozen to my legs as the rain persisted. The long track descended all the way into Garrigill (D) before a quiet riverside walk to Alston.\nBefore I’d set off back in Edale I’d decided I would allow myself to make use of a hostel every few days to break from camping, though I hadn’t needed one in the first ten legs. The YHA at Alston was on the approach to the town, and I decided I could do with a proper rest. It was a great little place: the chap running it was friendly and helpful, I got a room to myself for £15, there were teabags and someone had even left a chocolate cake with a ‘Please Eat Me’ sign on it. I took a shower and hung my socks to dry in the laundry room. My friend Dave surprised me with a call from Calcutta to see how I was getting on and offer some encouragement.\nIt was wonderful to have a bed. I wouldn’t have to wear my hat and gloves and curl up in my sleeping bag. I wouldn’t have to turn over every time my sides went numb. I wouldn’t wake up at dawn shivering. I had a pillow.\n\n\n\n\n736 — ’Where’s The Path?’s."

    "text": "Day 12: Alston to Greenhead\nOver breakfast at the hostel, I chatted to a couple on my table who were on a driving and cycling holiday.\n\n‘I did the Pennine Way—well, nearly did it—twenty years ago now. I got to Bellingham and fractured my shin jumping off a stile.’\n\nOuch! I still had a couple of days walking before Bellingham, so I certainly wouldn’t be jumping off anything before then. I devoured as much breakfast as I could, including three Weetabix, eggs, veggie sausages, mushrooms, beans, hash brown and a whole rack of toast with marmalade.\nI’d read that this leg would likely be the dullest of the Pennine Way but, to be quite honest, I’d had quite enough excitement with Cross Fell the day before so I wasn’t too bothered.\nThe first section followed a road and railway north through the valley of the South Tyne. On the left slope of the valley, I hopped over stiles through farmland. The only item of note was Whitley Castle (A), the remains of a Roman auxiliary fort. I didn’t spy it initially, only realising up close that the narrow undulations near the path were actually the remarkable rhomboid ramparts of this second-century stopover on the Maiden Way, which connected a fort on the York–Carlisle road with Carvoran on Hadrian’s Wall.\nContinuing north, the route took me across the road and under the railway into Slaggyford. Leaving the river, I passed under a pleasing arched railway viaduct, through more farms into Knarsdale and joined that old Roman Maiden Way over Lambley Common.\nAfter Lambley, the route left the road I’d followed all morning to head out over desolate moors. Hartleyburn and Blenkinsopp Commons were big, open hills and the hike—mile after mile of slow climbing—was tiring. The vague ramble west eventually brought me to the fence I would follow all the way to to the top of Blenkinsopp (B).\nEventually, I weaved my way through abandoned mine workings to the noisy A69 road linking Carlisle and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Unfortunately, the quickest way into Greenhead was to walk behind the highway barrier, over the service station fast-food wrappers and cola cans that so many idiots had discarded from their windows; trying not to breathe in too much lorry exhaust.\nGreenhead seemed quite uninteresting. Its main preoccupation seemed to be with the big road. It was hardly village-like. I fancied a pint but the hotel didn’t look appealing. A campsite was suggested on the map, so I headed straight for it.\nA little old lady, in her seventies or eighties, called from behind me as I walked up the road; she’d seen me walk too far with that big rucksack on. ‘Are you looking for camping?’ she asked, in a lovely half-geordie, half-scottish accent. She led me back to the green lawn behind her pretty house. ‘We’ve not had anyone yet this year, but you’re welcome to stay.’ We had a short chat about where I’d been and where I was off to next. Bellingham was a long way to go in one day, she thought. As she hadn’t mentioned payment yet, I asked how much it was. She frowned as though she didn’t really want to charge. ‘Oh, three pounds it is love. My son looks after the camping usually, but he’s away just now. You’ll need twenty pence pieces for the shower, do you have any?’ I didn’t, so she put four in my hand and tottered back into the porch.\nI showered, performed my daily replacement of the plasters holding my feet together and cooked up some couscous as the shadows of tall conifers stretched long across the grass.\n\n2.5 — Litres of Lucozade."

    "text": "Day 13: Greenhead to Bellingham\nI packed up early from the garden in Greenhead, but the sweet old lady was up by the time I was leaving and waved me off from the porch, opening the front door to wish me ‘good luck!’. I waved back and walked down the hill back into the village. As I consulted my map for the correct path leading north to Thirlwall Castle and Hadrian’s Wall, a man in a somewhat incongruous ten-gallon hat came over to point me right. In that same half-geordie, half-Scottish brogue which seemed to me the nicest thing about this place, he told me he’d always wanted to do the Pennine Way, and wished me well. Walking alone for days, these little encouragements really cheered me up and having received two before I’d even got going from Greenhead, I had a spring in my step.\nThirlwall Castle was built from stone taken from the Wall and the nearby fort of Carovan. It sounds like historical vandalism but in the violent borderlands of the Middle Ages, keeping alive against the best efforts of marauding mobs was clearly more important than preserving heritage. The Way meets and follows the Hadrian’s Wall Path here, another National Trail tracing the length of this World Heritage Site. Eager to see the Wall, I got a march on past the few morning dog-walkers.\nI’ve visited the Wall before on a family outing, but it was just as exciting to see again up close. Not only did it represent a significant marker on my journey (‘I set off from Derbyshire, and I’m all the way up here!’), but it’s such an impressive work of engineering. Augmenting the already towering northern face of the Whin Sill—that same lump of Dolerite that we met at the Low and High Force waterfalls, where the Tees falls off its southern edge—the barricade stretches 117 km (80 Roman miles) across the width of Britain. And once you’ve applied a little imagination to picture the original five metres of stone that stood up from the foot of the ramparts, the forts and turrets, the ten thousand troops in service, even the emperor himself striding across the land inspecting the merciless wastes to the north, it can’t fail to enthrall.\nThis time, alas, I knew I’d need to be disciplined in limiting the time I had to enjoy views and explore forts, and plough through the 10 km to Steel Rigg relatively quickly. I was tackling two of the recommended day sections in one go, so a good early pace was essential. But stomping up and down the steep undulations of the Sill was unexpectedly sapping, and I was contending with a painful right knee. Since Middleton, I’d had to chomp Ibuprofen as soon as I woke to reduce the soreness enough to get it moving, but the big steps here were agony and I was beginning to worry again if it would stop me getting to Scotland.\nThe morning went on, and I passed energetic bunches of youngsters brought out on half-term excurstions by their parents, gleefully disobeying the ‘Please don’t walk on the wall’ signs. I considered it myself—who doesn’t like balancing on a wall? Through the Aesica fort, and along Crawfield Crags, I passed some English Heritage workers painstakingly fixing a bit. I suppose you still can’t be too careful with the Scots. Up on Windshields Crags (A), I reached the highest point of the Sill. Here I paused to look north and get my first glimpse of my final opponent, the superboss: The Cheviot. That dark, whalebacked hill stood out menacingly on the horizon. ‘See you in a couple of days.’\nI descended to Once Brewed, gazing north the whole time as I reached the final section of wall I’d cover. ‘A fascinating and threatening place, it must’ve seemed like the end of the world to the Romans,’ says the Guide, and I wouldn’t disagree.\nBefore Vercovium, the Pennine Way departs from the Hadrian’s Wall Path and heads north between Greenlee and Broomlee Loughs. By this point, it felt like I’d done a day’s walking, but I wasn’t even half way. At least these marshy fields were less work for my knee. Here I entered my first proper covered section, Wark Forest. The dark woods enclosing the path certainly made a change from the exposed moorlands I’d gotten used to. I entered a clearing, with a stone the Guide told me marked the spot legend has it a local chieftain was slain by one of King Arthur’s chums, or something like that. ‘The desolation of the place may cause you to hasten on your way.’ No doubt.\nFinally leaving the forest for grassy moorland, the route became a bit difficult to follow, but I managed to find the concealed waterfall I was looking for at Warks Burn (B). Through a couple of farms, I caught up to, and walked a short way with, a couple who were taking the Way in sections. I marched on to the grandly- and amusingly-named Shitlington Hall, and then a while later stopped at the end of a large field with no exit in the barbed wire. I stood confused as the sheep smirked at my stupidity. I grumpily retraced my steps and found the sign I’d missed, hidden behind a parked old Mercedes at the farm. Shitlington indeed. Trudging up a hill to the relay tower that was my next target, I embarrassedly greeted and passed the couple again.\nThe long walk on boring tarmac into Bellingham reintroduced me to every ache and pain in my legs and feet, but the final stretch through the quaint town, along the bank of the North Tyne in the evening light, raised my mood.\nI found the farm I was looking for, which offered camping, and took a shower. The facilities here were great! I could use a cozy room in a converted barn, with a basic kitchen and a lovely potbelly stove in the corner to warm by. This would beat lying in a cold, wet tent. Bellingham had a Co-op, from which I bought a big bag of stuffed pasta, a huge apple pie with a tub of double cream, and a couple of cans of bitter.\nOn returning, I found other guests at the farm: a group of friends, in their 40s or 50s perhaps, who’d started at Kirk Yetholm a few days before and were walking the Way southbound. They set out to find a pub, but left sitting by the fire was a chap silently sipping tea. I joined him once I’d eaten, being careful not to disturb his peace, and we slowly got to talking. A German professor of East Asian languages, he was on a cycling holiday around the north of England, which he talked of fondly. He’d been at Durham for many years, he explained, and loved the landscapes here. He talked about the joy of exploring slowly, taking time to stop and enjoy views, as opposed to trying to get countryside ‘done’. Often feeling I would like more time to stop in places along my journey, I appreciated this sentiment. Now and then I prompted him with questions about his travels in Japan and Korea, and he seemed happy enough to talk while I was happy to listen. He had a quiet temper of the kind I would like to age into.\nWhen the others returned, we talked more jovially about walking and other adventures, and I must admit to feeling a little proud when they roundly commended me on making it so far. The atomsphere by that potbelly stove was really pleasant. When I went to bed, booming snores resounded around me, but after all that walking I was soon out cold myself.\n\n\n4 — Roman forts."

    "text": "Day 14: Bellingham to Byreness\nFollowing the 30-odd kilometres covered the day before, this penultimate leg through the Kielder forest promised to be a lighter piece before the finale over the Cheviot hills and into Scotland on Saturday.\nHappily, I was also walking to meet my mum and dad, who were driving up to meet me in the afternoon. They’d kindly offered to collect me at the end of my walk so I wouldn’t need to negotiate the buses and trains back home. Better still, dad had decided to join me for the final leg, after enjoying our walk from Crowden to Blackstone Edge two weeks before, so this would be my last day of walking solo.\nLeaving Bellingham at 8 o’clock, north towards Blakelaw, I passed ruins of mine workings, and the remains of a coal railway track. Via the stiles of Hareshaw House, I met and crossed the B road to Otterburn, and slowly climbed the moorland to Deer Play (A), ‘a wide wilderness with limitless views’, and up to the summit at Whitley Pike. The next ascent, Padon Hill (B), had a tumulus built on top by the owners of Otterburn Hill in the 1920s. The growing mass of Kielder approached, and down at Brownrigg Head I reached and followed its edge for a distance, apprehensively looking under the perimeter of trees into the dark within. Cold steam rose from the canopy. The path led me in at Rookengate, at which the woods swallowed me for the day. It’s a little hard to describe the feeling of being deep in those acres and acres of Norway Spruce. It gets repetitive much sooner than being up on a barren hill or on an open plain, where at least there are usually distant vistas to give some distraction. Here there were only the closest trees, the gloom beyond, and a persistent sense of unease. I imagine a better understanding of nature would help, as one would be able to appreciate the birds and small variety in trees, but to me it was the same one hour to the next. And so my mind would drift into considering the size of the forest, and how easy it might be to disappear into, and if there weren’t people living in there unknown to the rest of the island. Escaped convicts, even! And then a twig would snap and I’d hurry on my way.\nForests are great though. It’s fun to imagine what England must’ve been like before so much of it was chopped to make way for agriculture and settlements. Cities and towns, all oak and birch. Kielder is, of course, a modern addition—grown in response to timber shortages following World War I, it’s a huge mass of Norway Spruce. Yes, a mixed and native woodland would be more appealing, but I reckon this is better than no forest at all.\nI escaped the dark and reached my destination at about three o’clock. I called mum in the car, as dad drove, to boast that I’d beaten them there. As they were still an hour away, I decided to explore the village. It took all of five minutes—Byreness is not a place. Built by the Forestry Commission to house forest workers (who were soon replaced by machinery) it consisted of a couple of ugly cul-de-sacs, a closed-down pub and a decrepit petrol station. A pretty Methodist church offered its only reprieve. The camp site was back down the main road, so I was glad to be getting a lift. The petrol station had a little shop and a couple of picnic tables, so I decided that would be the best place to wait. I dropped my bag and glugged on the Lucozade I had left from the Bellingham Co-op. I had intended to investigate the shop and pick up a snack, but as the cashier (or owner, or whatever) came to the window to give me a pointedly scornful look (presumably as I had stopped to rest my legs before buying something from them) I decided they were getting no pennies from me.\nIt was great to see mum and dad, share hugs and sit in a warm, familiar car. We drove down to the campsite. It turned out this place also had rooms available, which they kindly came back with keys to. So we’d have comfortable beds before the last effort. Even better, they drove me to a restaurant in Otterburn, where I hobbled through the lounge on my battered feet to enjoy a big tasty meal. I was still apprehensive, remembering the tales I’d heard of the Cheviots along the way, remembering how hard it was to do 30 or 35 kilometers, remembering how dangerous Cross Fell had been and that The Cheviot was even more infamous. Would my knee make it through a day of 40 kilometers over even more big hills? Would there be enough daylight, even setting off at dawn? I was certainly glad dad was going to be coming with me. This was going to be tough!\n\n\n13 — Plasters holding feet together."

    "text": "Day 15: Byreness to Kirk Yetholm\nI jumped out of bed after just a few thuds of the heart with the alarm clock’s wail. From all the tales I’d heard of the Cheviots — from journals, books and other walkers I’d met on the way — I’d been anxiously thinking about this day for weeks. And here it was, our own Chevy chase. Could we really do these two huge legs in one day?\nAt the first hint of dawn, dad and I quietly gathered our packs, sticks and maps, and set off down the road to the little church in Byreness to rejoin the Way. My apprehensiveness was lessened somewhat by the clear brightening skies — the weather vowed to be kind at least. We turned right off the road and with early freshness attacked the first abrupt climb out of the valley floor, giving us 400 metres of height quickly and getting our legs moving.\nWith the forest now falling below us to the left, we ventured north but quickly met some of the soggiest ground I’d met in the whole walk, with no boards or stones to offer assistance. It was frustrating to spend so much time moving sideways in search of viable routes and often having to turn back when we came to dead ends. Dad was finding it a bit harder than me to traverse the bogs, and after a while we realised that the plastic skirt around the spike on his stick had broken off — so while I was finding small patches of grass to pole vault from, he was sinking straight in to the mud.\nMore Ministry of Defence signs warned us not to touch any military debris we might come across as we aimed for some ancient military debris: the Roman marching camp of Chew Green (A). The camp was a stopover on Dere Street, the colossal highway ordered by Governor Agricola to connect Eboracum (modern-day York) with the shores of the Firth of Forth.\nWe followed this Roman road north now deeper into the wilderness of the border hills. We were making excellent time moving at top hiking speed, and I worried we might tire ourselves out while full of adrenaline.\nWe passed a mountain refuge hut before climbing up to Lamb Hill and then Beefstand Hill (B) at 562 metres. At this point, dad and I both started to feel pain — me once again in my knee and dad in a hip. After weighing up our options, we chomped down the painkillers we’d brought in the hope that they’d keep us going at this pace. It meant we wouldn’t have any to call on later, however.\nThe imposing peak of Windy Gyle (C) lies right on the border between England and Scotland, marked by a fence that we tracked right to the top, where stands Russell’s Cairn. Centuries ago, the wardens of the violent borderlands met upon these empty windy peaks to negotiate truces. At once such meeting on this very spot, discussion turned sour and Lord Russell was violently murdered in cold blood.\nThe Guide remarks\n\nDesolate… with violent and sinister associations, Windy Gyle is one of the atmospheric highlights of The Pennine Way.\n\nFor the first time, we crossed over the border — I had walked to Scotland. For now we didn’t advance far into the country as the Way follows the border fence closely, crossing back and forth. We dropped along a ridge to meet another ancient road, Clennell Street (D). We were making excellent progress — my target for this half-way point was one o’clock and it was only noon. The Guide recommends stopping here if there are fewer than six hours of daylight remaining, as it is possible to walk several kilometres north to a track where a car pick up can be arranged. From here on in, there would be no short escape before Yetholm.\nWe spotted several wild goats out on the heather-covered slopes on our way to Kings Seat, and up to meet the point where the route branches to the summit of the Cheviot (E). Having gazed at that shadowy humped hill getting closer over the past few days, and with the weather sunny, we saw no reason not to take the five kilometre detour.\nSoon we wondered if we’d made the right choice, as the wind got fierce and the flat, long rise to the top was entirely covered with the deep, dark mire. This was a really tough stomp. Reaching the top, we sheltered behind the cairn to regroup and chomp down sandwiches and biscuits. The views from the summit aren’t the best because it’s such a domed hill, but catching sight of the North Sea out towards Bamburgh and Seahouses—where we’d spent a lovely beach holiday when I was small—was exciting.\nWe didn’t hang around long up there before stomping our way back down through the bog. After wasting a lot of time on the way up trying our best to avoid the deeper pools, we realised the futility and just marched as straight as we could on the way down, which led to some comically deep drops into mud.\nArriving back at the trunk path, we dived down the sheer slope west to a second refuge hut, taking a curious look in through the window. We scaled a high border ridge with stunning vistas to the left and right, struggling our way to the top of The Shill (F). Though lower than The Cheviot by a couple of hundred metres, this summit offered a splendid full panorama of the hill range under crisp blue skies. We paused to breathe it all in. This, we thought, was the last big climb of the way, and it deserved to be savoured.\nOn the descent from the Schill, dad and I were both really suffering from our injuries, and completely out of painkillers. My knee was agony, and dad’s hip was the same. We were limping, slowing down and running out of energy. At the bottom, the path forks and two options are available for the final section into Kirk Yetholm: appropriately, the high road or the low road. The latter is suggested if the weather is bad or daylight is running out. As appealing as the low route was with the pain we were in, I hadn’t come all this way to miss out hills at the very end. The high road it was.\nAfter the good work we’d done on the climbs so far, that of White Law was the hardest all day. The vertical trudge seemed to last all afternoon — we just couldn’t get to the top. At this point we were walking quite apart, dad needing to walk a little slower. I had been practicing for two weeks, remember, and dad had matched me all day on the longest and hardest leg, which was impressive!\nFrom White Law we were finally, finally, finally on the descent to Kirk Yetholm, between lower, greener hills, across the ford of another trickling burn and onto a tarmac road: the home straight. Of course, this being the Pennine Way, it was still another mile or so on the hard road and now we were seriously limping, just trying to drag our tired legs to the finish line.\nEarly evening light poured into the valley, and I felt a strange mix of relief, apprehension, pain, pride and some sadness. The adventure was nearly over. Here it was, Kirk Yetholm, the mystical name I’d murmured to myself so many times over the last fortnight. I thought back to the moment I stepped off a train in Edale, rested my foot on a dry stone wall, adjusted the straps on my backpack and took a first step which led me all the way here.\nStaggering down into the village, we spotted my mum, who’d arrived in the car with perfect timing to meet us. The official end of the Pennine Way is the bar of the Border Hotel. Exhausted and happy, we limped into the dark pub to procure celebratory pints. We carried them back to enjoy at a bench in the warm Scottish evening sun, and mum surprised me with a bottle of champagne. Bitter, bubbly, family and the joy of pushing my battered and blistered feet into that cool grass — glorious!\n\n9 — Counties visited."

For the past two weeks I’d known exactly what I needed to do all day long: walk. Now I was back to real life, where I constantly had to make decisions about how to spend my time. And that is hard, isn’t it?\nExcept, I realised, that I didn’t need to make these decisions all the time; I was just doing it because I’m that kind of a worrier. And I realised it’s a huge waste of time. I can get far more and far better things done if I stop prevaricating, procrastinating and questioning myself constantly. I should just see what I ought to do and then resolve to do it. Along with the incredible vistas I’ll remember for a lifetime, that’s probably the most important thing I took from two weeks of silent reflection on the beautiful hills of northern England. Now I’m rested and recovered, I can’t wait to get back up there.\nIt’s a cliché, but I couldn’t have done this walk without my mum and dad. Their pick-ups and drop-offs made the logistics possible, and I borrowed nearly all the equipment I needed from them. They even bought me the new boots I walked in. So this is a big thank you to them. Thanks to my grandad Ronnie, who supplied me with two weeks’ supply of Capt. Scott’s Expedition Biscuits. I had to survive on those for a day and a half before I got my stove working. Thanks to Jim, who was great company for two fine days to break up the solitary walking.\nI doff my walking hat to Tom Stephenson (whose idea the Pennine Way was), National Trails for keeping it well maintained and the ramblers of the 1932 mass trespass of Kinder Scout8, who fought for our right to roam this beautiful island."

But I was not unaware of the importance of it during my stomp; indeed, one of the helpful National Trail leaflets mapped out the different ‘depositions’ and ‘intrustions’ making up each area I passed through, and offered a nice quote to convey the importance: ‘To look at the scenery without trying to understand the rock is like listening to poetry in an unknown language. You hear the beauty, but you miss the meaning.’ — Norman Nicholson. The feature called Whin Sill is noteworthy. It is a particularly hard slab of igneous Dolerite that squirted up, in molten form, from below the crust before solidifying between layers of existing rock. As this softer rock has eroded around its edges, the Dolerite is exposed in remarkable cliffs. Here at High Force, it is the precipice over which the Tees falls.

Dickens pulling subscribers into his new publishing startup. The least Dickensian of his novels for its shift of weight from character to plot.\n‘Recalled to life.’ For a book with among the most famous first and last lines of any written, the note handed to the banker on the Dover mail coach tells us most of what it’s about.

This is a short introduction.\nA Line in the Sand by James Barr — A stroke of pen on a map with long-lasting effect, in 1916 Sykes and Picot partitioned the territories of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East between the empires of Britain and France. Barr sources declassified archives to tell the inglorious colonialist history through the decades that followed.\nThe Idea of the Brain by Matthew Cobb ★ — An enlightening history of our understanding of probably the most complex and inscrutible object we know of. The book combines a chronicle of ideas since Aristotle and a tour of the current state of neuroscience.\nI suppose my prior conception of the brain would be a naturally evolved computer that allows organisms to control physical functions, learn and respond to the environment. Cobb makes a clear argument that the computer is just the latest in a line of metaphors based on the technology of the day: mechanical clockwork, hydraulic automaton, telephone exchange and on. The brain computes but it is not much like a digital computer. It is electrochemical and analogue. Localising functions to particular parts of the brain is mostly not possible.\nI tend to credit physics for pushing much of 20th century progress in computing. That notion is countered here in the influence of neuroscience from the 40s, with Alan Turing’s test and John von Neumann’s interest in how neural circuits might encode information, to the 80s, with the work of Geoffrey Hinton et al. on backpropagation and the Perceptron.1 Thus especially recommended if you are interested in machine learning.\nFeet of Clay by Terry Pratchett ↻ — At 13, my English teacher noticed I wasn’t reading any fiction. Given time to read in school I’d head for a world atlas. At home I read a lot but mostly bible study.2 Mrs Clarke clearly had a good eye for what might catch my interest and wrote ‘Terry Pratchett’ in my schoolbook with homework to find a novel of his in the library and report back on it.\nThe one I found was Moving Pictures and I’d never read anything like it. I went back to the library for the first Discworld book, then the second. My mum worked in a WH Smith shop and told me there was going to be a new book in the series called Feet of Clay. This was exciting, I had not considered there would be new ones. She ordered it for me and then through Hogfather, Jingo, The Last Continent, Carpe Jugulum and The Fifth Elephant I bought each paperback when it came out.\n\nAnd, while it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited to the very best social occasions.\n\nThe Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson ★ — A narrative history of the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern US to Northern and West Coast cities in the twentieth century, pushed by Jim Crow oppression and terror in the South and pulled by demand for factory labour in the North.\n\nThey did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have often done. They left.\n\nThe book stands out both for its broad analysis and for its deeply researched detail on the three life stories that carry it along. Ida Mae Brandon Gladney left Mississippi in the 30s to work blue-collar jobs in Chicago. George Swanson Starling left Florida in the 40s for New York City and worked as a porter travelling up and down that same route. Robert Joseph Pershing Foster left Louisiana for Los Angeles in the 50s to work as a doctor. Ray Charles, a patient, praised him in song.\nThese destinations were not random but determined by railway tracks. Migrants from Florida and Georgia took the coastal route up to Boston and New York. Those from Alabama and Mississippi followed the river up to the Midwest cities of Detroit and Chicago. Those from Texas and Louisiana took the trains west to Los Angeles and Oakland. Their exodus took them from the enforced poverty, brutality and segregation of their old rural lives but each of course met prejudice and hostility in their new homes.\nAt Home by Bill Bryson — Spending all my time at home in lockdown I thought it might be interesting to read this history of domestic life. I didn’t enjoy it as much as his travel books but there are the usual interesting facts and stories.\nBrit(ish) by Afua Hirsch — ’Where are you from?’ Hirsch calls this The Question, asked of her repeatedly with the felt implication that what the questioner wants to know is ‘Where are you really from?’ This gave me pause because it’s a question I often ask people I meet as an opening for them to talk. I would say I don’t care what the answer is, it might be‘right here’ or more than one place3, but directly asking about identity is not neutral. I’ve been thinking about something else to ask.\nThe book is good on analysis of the intersection of race, class and poverty in Britain. It’s also good in describing Britain’s post-imperial identity crisis. Part of it is in the attempt to be a post-racial society without actually coming to terms with the racial society we have been and still are. That process is difficult — as the reaction to the sinking of the slaver statue in Bristol has shown — but necessary. I take visitors to Manchester past Lincoln Square and talk about the mill workers who refused to work slave-picked cotton but when I’m walking past the grand Victorian buildings I don’t think about how much textile industry innovation and wealth had been built on that slave labour.\nMy Name is Why by Lemn Sissay — the two things I knew about Sissay before reading this are that he wrote the poem I often run past on the side of Hardy’s Well in Rusholme, and that he is the current chancellor of the University of Manchester. This memoir covers his childhood from when his mother, a young Ethiopian student, was placed in a ‘Home for Unmarried Mothers’ in Wigan. Sissay was taken against her will by social services who took away his name and his story, renaming him Norman. It’s a story of cruel institutions that had a duty to care for him and didn’t.\nOpen Borders by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith — George Mason University economist Caplan teams up with SMBC cartoonist Weinersmith to make the case for rich countries to allow free migration, including untapped trillions in potential wealth as well as clear moral imperative. Caplan takes strong opposing arguments and rebuts them persuasively. But then I live in a city and already see migration as overwhelmingly positive. The arguments focus on economic rather than cultural outcomes, which I think people who are less welcoming of migration tend to be more concerned about. The illustration lightens up what could be dry economic argument and shows how, done as well as this, graphic nonfiction can be a brilliant way to present ideas.\nThe New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander — The robustly argued case that the racial inequity of the criminal justice system in the United States can be thought of as a third era of segregation after slavery and Jim Crow laws.\nThe Sum of the People by Andrew Whitby ★ — Counting people might sound like an uncontroversial and mundane statistical4 task, but this history of the census since the idea’s origins in ancient China is absorbing. The Exodus of the Israelites in the Old Testament got a whole Book of Numbers for census results. The founding fathers of the United States thought a regular census important enough to write it into the Constitution, though infamously counted a black slave as three-fifths of a free white man. Nazi Germany used census data as a tool for genocide. In 1944 a risky daytime Allied air raid on the Kleykamp building in The Hague was sent out to destroy the identity records of the Dutch population with the aim of protecting some of those the Nazis would persecute.\nWho is counted and who isn’t? What questions should be asked? Such decisions are contested each time around. The census is a balance of representation in democracy for the individual and valuable information for the state.\n\nThis version of the census — still used in most countries today — was a compromise. It acknowledged an unavoidable trade-off between privacy and the state’s need to see in order to function. The traditional census, at its best, has been able to find a delicate balance between these opposed aims. It has succeeded in this because enumeration, by its very nature, requires mass participation, and so the census is owned neither by the state nor by the people but exists as a continuous negotiation between the two.\n\nJingo by Terry Pratchett ↻ — After the years I spent buried in Discworld books, I went off to university to pick up other interests and affectations like ‘serious’ literature and cardigans. In my 30s I’m returning to my teenage enjoyment of fun books and parkas.\n\nIt was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone’s fault. If it was Us, what did that make Me? After all, I’m one of Us. I must be. I’ve certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We’re always one of Us. It’s Them that do the bad things.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin ★ — I enjoyed this a lot once I’d gotten into the world-building terminology, especially the final trek across the ice sheet back to Karhide.\nCaste by by Isabel Wilkerson — After The Warmth of Other Suns, I eagerly picked this up the day it was released. Wilkerson rigourously frames the subject of racial inequality and injustice in the United States in terms of a caste system.\nHateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage by Alice Munro ★ — I love how Munro will settle you into this familiar place, probably in rural Canada, probably with some midlife characters, then unsettle you in just a few pages.\nAround the World in 80 Days by Michael Palin — Some of Palin’s TV programmes have been back on the BBC and reminded me how much I enjoy his work.\nNow You’re Gonna Believe Us by Andrew Robertson — I expect there will be a lot of books written about Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool FC and I expect I will want to read a lot of them.\nNew Europe by Michael Palin — A tour of Eastern Europe in the 00s, in flux between Soviet influence or rule and EU expansion.\nTequila Oil by Hugh Thomson — In 1979, aged 18, Thomson picks up a used Oldsmobile 98 to drive across the US border down through Mexico in a woozy trip working odd jobs, drinking and visiting Mayan sites on a quest to sell the car in Belize to pay his way home.\nA Promised Land by Barack Obama — Nothing unexpected but all enjoyable to read. Most interesting to me were the insights into how multilateral events like the Copenhagen Summit in 2009 actually work and the process leading to the Navy SEAL kill-or-capture operation for Osama bin Laden. I look forward to the next volume.\nThe Moth and the Mountain by Ed Caesar ★ — An adventure. After the early attempts to conquer Everest by George Mallory5 and others, in 1934 Bradfordian WWI veteran Maurice Wilson made an eccentric solo attempt to stand first on Earth’s highest point by flying a second-hand Gipsy Moth plane from London to Tibet and crash landing on the slopes of the mountain. He had an imperial bureaucracy set on stopping him, no climbing experience beyond a hike up Coniston Old Man and only a few hours of flying lessons.\nTerra Incognita by Ian Goldin and Robert Mugs — Analysis of the major trends and problems we face in human progress and what they might mean for us all in the remainder of the century. Well-illustrated with ‘100 maps to survive the next 100 years’.\nIn Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman by William J. Cook — An introduction to the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Cook is a leading researcher on the TSP and this is an excellent guide through the history of the problem and approaches to solving it. The TSP can seem like an obscure applied mathematics problem at first glance but, as this book makes clear, the understanding gained from the problem and heuristics for solving it have been broadly useful in combinatorial optimization and theoretical computer science."

    "text": "Note: This post is from 2011 and out of date. Some of the apps below no longer exist. It’s kept for historical interest.\nEven if you, quite reasonably, don’t know what computational physics is, I’m sure you can imagine that what I do most days involves spending a lot of time sat with a computer. I choose to use one with a glowing white fruit on it, as do many, for all sorts of reasons. One of the reasons I like Apple computers is the quality of the software available for OS X, and as the introduction of the Mac App Store has put the spotlight on Mac apps I thought I’d write about some of my favourite for doing science.\nThe apps I’m writing about are all of a sort, and its perhaps easiest to describe them by what they are not. First, they’re not the behemoths of scientific computing, the big Ms: Mathematica, Matlab, Maple and Multiphysics. These — as you will know if you’ve used them — are powerful pieces of kit, and come with price tags to match. Their user interfaces are ported across all platforms. In my opinion, these interfaces can be clumsy1 and slow compared to those tailored to the system they will be used on.\nSecond, they’re not applications specific to one narrow area. There’s little value in me recommending the quantum chemistry or molecular dynamics software we use — if you need to use them you will likely know about them anyway.\nSo what sort are these apps? Well, I’d say they all follow the Unix philosophy, ‘Write programs that do one thing and do it well.’2 They’re written in Cocoa and each show care has been taken in getting the look and feel of great Mac software. They’re written by small, indie companies, or in one case a mathematician with open source help. They’re inexpensive and good value.\nAcquilia’s Soulver is like TextEdit with a built-in calculator. Start putting in numbers and it will tally up on the right. You can add all the constants you might wish to drop in, and reference values from previous lines. I think the demo video demonstrates its usefulness better than any further rambling from me.\nWhere before I might have resorted to launching a spreadsheet to say, convert some results to atomic units — with all the slowness and faffery that brings — now I can fire up what is essentially a text file that can do sums. It’s simple and super. I also like the ‘Big Answer’ button, which makes final results more exciting, even if I am still out by an order of magnitude.\nOne thing I would like is support for greek alphabet constants, those 26 romans get used up very quickly."

MacTeX thus gives you everything so you can try them all and see what you like. Obviously, this means it’s a huge (~1 GB) download.\n\n\n\nTeXShop is simple to use, with a text editor for input and a preview of the PDF once the document has been successfully typeset. The Macros menu offers prefabbed layouts, tables, references and so on. Personally, all I’m using TeXShop for now is for writing, then using the keyboard shortcuts for ‘Attach Bibliography’, ‘Typeset’ and ‘Preview PDF’.

I hadn’t intended to include Transmit at first, as FTP is of course useful to a far broader group of people —  web developers, particularly. However, I upgraded to Transmit 4 a few weeks ago and was wowed by a new feature which is already helping me to work quicker.\n\n\n\nIn computational science we often log into more powerful machines loaded with simulation software to run the codes we’ve written — it might be a multicore desktop in the institute or a supercomputer facility in a different city. This usually involves working with files locally and then sending them over to one of the big machines to compile and run —  which would previously involve a long series of terminal commands. Transmit 4 has this wonderful Disks feature which allows me to mount a folder on a university computer as a drive on my Mac, via SFTP, so I can drag and drop files to it. Utterly brilliant.\nFinally, I should give a mention to the window in which I spend most of my time: typing Vim commands into the trusty old Terminal.\n\n\n\nAnother multi-platform tool I find indispensible is the remarkable, free, world-conquering Dropbox. As well as syncing all my working projects between computers and my phone, the version tracking has saved me many times after a misplaced Save, and even given me an up-to-the-minute backup of my work when a hard drive failed.3"

    "text": "SPQR by Mary Beard — You can only learn things by attaching them to what you’ve already learned, and I hadn’t learned much about a thousand years of Roman history. That said, I got more out of it than expected because Beard’s writing is fun and the book is rarely dry.\nOne thing I do know about is the wood tablets at the fort of Vindolanda at Hadrian’s Wall, because I’ve been to see them at the museum there. When the first tablets were peeled apart and the ink writing discovered, they were rushed to the university at Durham but oxidised before they could be transcribed. The message was thought lost but at the medical school they found they could still read it in the infrared. And they’ve been able to protect many of the rest dug up so you can see them yourself. The tablets include the oldest surviving writing in Latin by a woman, an invitation to a birthday party. I recommend a visit.\nThe Hunt for Red October by Tom Clancy — I always picture Jack Ryan as Alec Baldwin.\nThe Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri ★ — A sweeping but intimate novel that starts in 1960s Calcutta with two young brothers, Subhash and Udayan. Their lives fork, an impulsive Udayan caught up in the Naxalite movement at home and a studious Subhash setting out for university and a life in New England. It’s about staying and leaving, about parenthood, loss, guilt and responsibility, through four generations of a family.\nEndurance by Alfred Lansing ★ — Lansing wrote this authoritative account of the Endurance expedition, having got hold of most of the diaries kept on the voyage and then interviewed the surviving crew. The mission of the great explorer to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic went awry when the tallship got stuck in the icepack of the Weddell Sea, was crushed and sank leaving the crew without a hope.\nThere’s no way to condense the ordeals and suffering the book details. It is unfathomable that they survived. After all that they’d endured over a year, Shackleton took a few men in the tiny open boat James Caird and navigated 800 miles over the most deadly ocean on the planet to hit their only hope of rescue, the speck of South Georgia island. Once there, they had to climb over the sawtooth mountains and glaciers of the interior to get to the whaling station, that itself a route nobody had survived attempting. Shackleton then went back to rescue every one of his crew.\nFrank Hurley shot early colour photographs and got the film home. They are beautiful.\nRagtime by E.L. Doctorow\nThe Carter of La Providence by Georges Simenon (Maigret #4) — Simenon is great at writing canals, as most other things.\nThe Innovators by Walter Isaacson — A history of the people who invented computers, microprocessors, software and the web, from Ada Lovelace to Larry Page. Each character in the story is met only briefly, because many people contributed.\nAnd that’s really the theme of the book. We still have this notion of looking for lone genius inventors when in fact innovation since the last century has driven by brilliant thinkers in collaboration and many incremental advances.\nChristianity by Linda Woodhead — It’s strange when I read histories of Christianity having spent my childhood in one branch of it. Things I think I know well seen from a different angle. In fact though she covers most churches, Woodhead doesn’t mention JWs.\nMost interesting in this brief review was to read about the early divide in church versus biblical Christianity. Also the role of mystical Christianity and the Catholic church’s successful absorption of the monastic movement to bring it under its own control.\nDeep Work by Cal Newport ★ — This book felt important, and I just counted the number of passages I’ve added to my notes from it: 94, which is maybe a record. This is close enough to the central thesis:\n\nThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\n\nAnd this from a section on life satisfaction:\n\nMost people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most people have this wrong. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\n\nThe Yellow Dog (Maigret #6) by Georges Simenon — A typical Maigret setting of a murder and a conspiratorial group of men in a small French town, this time Concarneau. Maigret sorts it all out with a few frothy beers of course.\nCities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy — The last in the Border Trilogy brings John Grady Cole and Billy Parham together soon after the Second World War, in work on a ranch. The Old Testament Cities of the Plain were Sodom and Gomorrah, so we know the old world is in fire and brimstone. They make the crossing of the Rio Grande once more to find the last of it. As always McCarthy writes horses better than women.\n\nThe man smiled at him a sly smile. As if they knew a secret between them, these two. Something of age and youth and their claims and the justice of those claims. And of their claims upon them. The world past, the world to come. Their common transciencies. Above all a knowing deep in the bone that beauty and loss are one.\n\nAlso this, from the New York Times review:\n\nThat brief moment between a culture’s existence and extinction – this is the border that McCarthy’s characters keep crossing and recrossing, and the one story, as he’s forever writing, that contains all others. Throughout the trilogy, we keep encountering witnesses – former revolutionaries, priests, gypsies – in whose testimony alone human history survives. As in Proust, the storytellers are inseparable from their tales.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War by Helen Graham — I’m putting together a reading pile on the Spanish Civil War, and I like these short intros for a place to start. I’d never considered that there’s no Civil War museum, though maybe in Barcelona soon. Francoists “always referred to the war as a ‘crusade’ or ‘fight for national liberation’”. A reminder how quickly people can turn to killing their own neighbours, even relatives, when scared and told these people are the danger. Britain’s non-intervention.\n\nThe military coup unleashed what was in effect a series of culture wars: urban culture and cosmopolitan lifestyles versus rural tradition, secular against religious; authoritarianism against liberal political cultures; centre versus periphery; traditional gender roles versus the ‘new woman’; even youth against age, since generational conflicts were also present.\n\nNew culture war, same as the old culture war.\nMen Without Women by Ernest Hemingway — This second set of stories was published in 1927. It’s the one with Hills Like White Elephants and The Killers. The stories flow through the gaps, and you know he’s reporting life where he’s seen it, whether bullfighting in The Undefeated, boxing in Fifty Grand or war on the Italian Front in Now I Lay Me and In Another Country.\nIn an interview, later:\n\nI can remember feeling so awful about the first war that I couldn’t write about it for ten years,” he said, suddenly very angry. “The wound combat makes in you, as a writer, is a very slow-healing one. I wrote three stories about it in the old days—‘In Another Country,’ ‘A Way You’ll Never Be,’ and ‘Now I Lay Me.’\n\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt ★ — This and The Secret History are two of the most enjoyable novels I can remember reading in a long time. Recommended by everyone, and now by me.\n\nCaring too much for objects can destroy you. Only–if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?\n\nWind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry — Saint-Ex wrote this memoir of his daring adventures as an early aviator for the French Aéropostale, expanding into his thoughts on friendship, death and living a meaningful life. He was a pioneer of the mail routes over the Sahara and the Andes. In undependable aircraft, over mountain terrain with navigation by landmarks on the ground or the stars at night, this was a perilous occupation.\n\nNothing, in truth, can ever replace a lost companion. Old comrades cannot be manufactured. There is nothing that can equal the treasure of so many shared memories, so many bad times endured together, so many quarrels, reconciliations, heartfelt impulses. Friendships like that cannot be reconstructed. If you plant an oak, you will hope in vain to sit soon under its shade. For such is life. We grow rich as we plant through the early years, but then come the years when time undoes our work and cuts down our trees. One by one our comrades deprive us of their shade, and within our mourning we always feel now the secret grief of growing old.\n\nOpen by Andre Agassi — The interesting thing about Agassi’s story is he hated his sport. Emmanuel Agassi, an Iranian Olympic boxer migrated to Las Vegas, decided his son would be a tennis pro before he was born. Rigged up a machine to fire balls at a toddler thousands of times a day and sent him on to academies. In Andre’s telling, by the time he got to decide what he wanted to do he only had one option, one he didn’t want. Even when that job got him rich, famous and married to Brooke Shields.\nOnly when things fell apart, he got a ban for crystal meth and dropped to the bottom did Agassi get to enjoy tennis. The rise from there back to world number one late in his career is the real sporting life.\nRunning with the Kenyans by Adharanand Finn — Finn moves for six months to the marathon capital of the world, a town in Kenya called Iten. He hopes to find out what makes the locals worldbeaters at distance running. Running miles to school every day? Running barefoot? Ugali? Altitude? Attitude? And of course it’s a bit of all of that. Except the barefoot running, Kenyans wear trainers.\nHidden City by Karl Whitney — I got this book about Dublin from Daunt before visiting in August, but it’s more a book for locals seeking out obscure bits of their city. Whitney explores underground rivers, ghost towns hit by the financial crash, sewage systems and bus networks. Luckily I can happily read about infrastructure all day, I don’t know why.\nThe Green Road by Anne Enright — Picked up from the great Irish fiction section of Chapters in Dublin. We have a family on the west coast of Ireland, Rosaleen and her children.\n\nHe did not seem happy, he seemed a bit impatient but, That is because I am well, Constance thought, I have been wasting his time with my robust good health, I have been wasting everyone’s time! Her clever body had been doing a great job. Complex. Microscopic. Quiet. The map of light that was her left breast was not frightful but beautiful, and the marbled black and white of its sonic depths was lovely too.\n\nConstance stays and the others go off to New York and Mali. We hear the separate stories of them, and then they’re brought back together.\n\nShe had not thought it would be dark, not yet, the way the Atlantic sky held the light for so long after the sun was down, something to do with the height of the heavens out here on the green road. The west was still open and clear, but the ground under her feet was tricky enough. All the colour was going from things and nothing was easy to see. You could not tell grey from grey.\n\nA Crime in Holland by Georges Simenon\nThe Grand Banks Café by Georges Simenon\nThe Undercover Economist Strikes Back by Tim Harford — The sequel to his tour of microeconomics, this one covers macro, with a bit of the life of Bill Phillips and his MONIAC hydraulic computer.\nWe learn about failures of supply like the ‘prison-camp recession’ and failures of demand like the ‘babysitting co-op recession’, and that in practice it’s hard to tell which is happening. So in response, short-run Keynes, long-run classical is a rule of thumb. It then covers inflation, printing money, GDP, and there’s a chapter explaining how independent central banks committed to low inflation work as Dr Strangelove-like doomsday devices. Having them should mean we don’t have to use them, but it was the ECB’s device that went off in Greece.\nA History of the World by Andrew Marr — I don’t know why after SPQR I’ve gone for another history book covering such a mad amount of time but I liked the style of Marr’s History of Modern Britain so thought I’d like this one too. The time spent on non-European histories was most useful for me, particularly what was going on in China relative to what was happening with Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Also the Americas and Russia. I should read some Tolstoy.\nMarr makes no apology for it being a history of significant individuals but doesn’t always convince me that someone else would not have come along with the same idea. Watt and his steam engine for one example, or Ghandi’s Salt March. In some cases it is clear that one person moved the world in a certain direction, like Zimmermann with his Telegram and most significantly Genghis Khan.\nThe Vital Question by Nick Lane ★ — Lane takes us through a radical, wide-ranging new theory on the origins of life and then complex life. The theory puts energy right at the centre of the problem with the sort of derivation from first principles you get in physics. So I enjoyed that.\n\nThe energy we gain from burning food in respiration is used to pump protons across a membrane, forming a reservoir on one side of the membrane. The flow of protons back from this reservoir can be used to power work in the same way as a turbine in a hydroelectric dam.\n\nIt starts with a search for the sort of consistent energy gradients needed to kick things off. He rules out lightning (not enough) and UV radiation (too destructive) but reveals one candidate on Earth with the right conditions: those hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean.\n\nExactly the kind of dissipative structures that we seek: continuous flow, far-from-equilibrium electrochemical reactors.\n\nOnce simple life is sorted we find out how, after two billion years with nothing but bacteria and archea, eukaryotes (complex life like animals and plants) branched off with one extremely rare event when a bacterium got inside an archea (the rare thing is that they didn’t both immediately die) and formed a nucleus with a mitochondria power plant. Why that was so revolutionary: single-cell organisms have a limit on how big they can get while bringing in enough energy to support themselves, because the energy throughput of the membrane is limited by surface area, which increases squared as the volume increases cubed.\nThe rest of the book takes the idea on to why complex life is like it is: sex, ageing, disease, death. There’s a lot of biology terms through the book, which left me needing the glossary or lost in an argument. He’s good at recapping though so I stopped being bothered about that, just skipping on to catch up.\nThe Marches by Rory Stewart — A journal of long walks in the borderlands between England and Scotland. The first, along Hadrian’s Wall, he takes with his 89-year-old father, comparing the end of Roman Empire with retreat of British Empire, which in the Malayan Civil Service and MI6 his father saw firsthand. The second is a meandering walk from Cumbria to Crieffe, investigating what it means to live in the middleland, and how firm the boundaries really are.\n\nWhile the people hereabouts (and a good way north) have over the past 2,000 years spoken Cumbrian, Welsh, Latin, Northumbrian, Norman French and Borders English, they have never spoken Scottish Gaelic and never called this place Alba.\n\nGrave New World by Stephen D. King — A look at the retreat of globalisation and return of nationalists over the last couple of years, and where this could take us.\nKillers of the Flower Moon by David Grann ★ {% include dash.html %} This is a shocking, tragic crime history from 1920s Oklahoma. The sisters in a family of the Osage tribe of Native Americans, rich from oil strikes on the rocky land they’d been shoved onto, started dying off. The surviving family have to pay for the new federal Bureau of Investigation to pull together a band to find the murderers and the conspiracy protecting them."

For now I’ve only done the lowest mileage (80 km per week) of the brutal training regimes, but even that moved my distance running on massively.\nAlong with the weekly plans, the chapters on physiology at the start helped me to understand how each of the many track sessions, intervals and long weekend runs develop VO2 max, lactate threshold and glycogen storage on the way to race fitness.\nHigh Quality Software Engineering by David Drysdale — This free book available from Drysdale’s homepage drew me in with the perspective offered of Lessons from the Six-Nines World, six-nines meaning 99.9999% uptime or 31 seconds downtime per year. It covers the main areas of software engineering: design, coding, reviews and testing, and declares three themes: maintainability, knowing reasons why and developing developers.\nFor me the most useful sections were on designing for scale and reliability and on testing strategies. Not so useful were those on project management, which felt dated. The list of technical fundamentals near the back will serve as a good to-do list for me.\nCapitalism by James Fulcher — A brief review of capitalism’s history, its emergence in Europe and current global reach. The most interesting chapter for me is the comparison between different models taken in the United States, Japan and Sweden. On the latter:\n\nThe labour movement’s leadership recognized that welfare depended not just on the strength of socialist ideas and working class organization but also on the operation of a dynamic capitalist economy that could compete internationally and increase the size of the national economic cake. It was one of the central principles of Swedish economic policy that unprofitable companies should be allowed to go bankrupt, so that their resources could be transferred to profitable sectors of the economy. Swedish workers were in this respect rather less protected than British workers by government interventions to bail out failing companies. Furthermore, the union-controlled labour market policy did not protect jobs but assisted workers to become mobile and retrain.\n\nThe Crossing by Cormac McCarthy ★ — The second book in the Border Trilogy is a story of three crossings of the Texas border by the teenaged Billy Parham. The first is a dreamlike journey to return a wild, pregnant wolf to its Mexican mountain home, the second and third follow in fate and circumstance.\n\nThe horse raising its head above the skyline to listen among the constellations and then bending to graze again. He studied those worlds sprawled in their pale ignitions upon the nameless night.\n\nI can never get enough of McCarthy’s runaway sentences and the made-up words that sound right as soon as you read them: ‘the godmade sun’, ‘the mute and footsore dog’, ‘the needlethin sweepsecond hand sectoring the dial’. The best are often saved for his keen-eyed attention to the animals.\nThe Secret History by Donna Tartt ★ — Pretty sure if I’d read this novel before 2012 I would not have spent the next three years living with classicists.\nPrisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall ★ — With our century’s aircraft, internet and supranational institutions, we may be tempted to think we’ve overcome the bounds of physical geography in global affairs. Our history is told in ideologies and leaders, good or bad.\n\nThere is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans. — Thomas Jefferson\n\nMarshall shows us that plains, rivers and mountains are still predominant in ten examples from around the world with corresponding maps. He explains why Tibet is important to China, why Russia cares so much about the north European plain, and why with the Louisiana Purchase complete, the United States was destined to be a superpower.\nHe might overstate the case a bit but as I never see this kind of analysis — only discussion of what Putin or Trump has said today — it’s a refreshing way of looking at things. It’s a shallow dive but comes with a decent bibliography to dig in further, which I intend to do.\nOpen City by Teju Cole — Open City follows the wandering thoughts of Julius on long walks around Manhattan. I put it on a reading list about New York I researched before visiting last October, then bought it from the geographically arranged shelves of McNally Jackson. So I expect the book will always remind me of that city, though the story resists ties of place.\nI put it down after a few pages. Nobody thinks like Julius, joining dots between Bach, Nietzsche, Auden, Mahler. I picked it up again and realised that the connection of ideas, people, places was the point. We might be at Ground Zero one moment and the Nigeria of his childhood next, or talking to a Moroccan writer in a Brussels internet café. We’re in Julius’ head. That’s all novels, but the fluency here makes it work.\nI heard the citizen of the world is a ‘citizen of nowhere’. Cole reminds us that art and people transcend nations. ‘I’m on a road to nowhere. There’s a city in my mind.’\nMindset by Carol Dweck — The most obvious criticism you can give Mindset is that Dweck takes 250 pages to explain a thesis that can be given in a couple of sentences: We should stop with the old debates of nuture versus nature, genes versus environment, as research shows a greater indicator of success is our approach to abilities. In broad strokes: we may have a fixed mindset and consider our qualities to be set, or a growth mindset and believe that our qualities can be developed through effort. Guess which works best.\nImportantly, the growth midset itself can be developed. Dweck is a research psychologist, and cites convincing studies to back up the argument, though none look at long-term effect. The rest of the book is given to examples from sports and business and sweeping, mostly obvious advice for applying mindsets to work, relationships and parenting.\n\nI’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. — Michael Jordan\n\nIt’s such a broad thesis that I suspect it’s easy to find examples to back it and hard to disprove. I’d say the most valuable advice in the book is this: don’t praise children for ability or talent. You’ll leave them fearing eventual failure, that you’ll see them turn out not to be no genius after all and be forever disappointed. Instead praise their successes for the effort and work that went into them.\nTravels with Charley by John Steinbeck — In 1960, at 58, Steinbeck makes a months-long tour around America with his French poodle Charley in a modified camper truck. He wants to see what’s changed in the years he’s been in Europe and New York. What he finds isn’t always positive: radio’s the same everywhere, some hitchhikers are racist. But for the most part his account of the open road and the the characters he finds on it is warm.\nMy Ántonia by Willa Carther ★ — A tough, romantic tale of the immigrant life of early settlers on the Nebraska plain in the age of the Homestead Act.\n\nThere seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made.\n\nÁntonia is a truly well-written character, and Carther is a master at both people and landscapes.\n\nI was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.\n\nTuring’s Cathedral by George Dyson — An early history of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Dyson has a good perspective from which to tell this story, as he grew up there while his father Freeman Dyson was a fellow.\nThough it is Turing’s name in the title, the book centres on the work of the Hungarian polymath John von Neumann, in the United States, to build the general-purpose ENIAC computer in the years up to 1946. Von Neumann, Teller and other hawks thought the best route to world peace was a ‘preventive’ hydrogen bomb strike on the Soviet Union, and the computer was intended to use their newly-invented Monte Carlo methods to simulate thermonuclear explosion. Thankfully that particular bomb was never dropped, peaceful uses for the computer were found in biology and meteorology, and the result of the von Neumann architecture is the digital world we now live in.\n\nIn some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose. — Robert Oppenheimer"

Then repeat. Your movement might look something like the circle above, which is moving according to electronic coin flips made by your computer.1\nWe call this kind of path a random walk in mathematics, and though it might not seem like much, random walks prove to be of great use in modelling complex systems in diverse fields, from financial markets to animal behaviour. It is also used everywhere in computational physics from the cosmological to the quantal, but perhaps the most familiar random walk in physics came in the form of a classical problem so we’ll start there."

    "text": "Brownian Motion\nIn 1827, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown looked through his microscope at pollen grains suspended in water and noted that they jittered around in a way he couldn’t explain.\nIt took until 1905 until a satisfactory answer was provided by Albert Einstein2 who brought some statistical methods to the problem, predicting that the random motion of the pollen grains was due to water being made up of molecules, which were continually bumping into the pollen grains. First he derived a diffusion equation for the grains, then he showed how to link this to physically measurable quantities starting with the mean squared dispacement (MSD), which we’ll come back to.\nThe reality of atoms and molecules was not fully accepted at that time, and Einstein viewed this model of Brownian motion as a way to give evidence for, or to falsify, the atomic theory. He wrote  in the paper:\n\nIf the movement discussed here can actually be observed (together with the laws relating to it that one would expect to find), then classical thermodynamics can no longer be looked upon as applicable with precision to bodies even of dimensions distinguishable in a microscope: an exact determination of actual atomic dimensions is even possible. On the other hand, had the prediction of this movement proved to be incorrect, a weighty argument would be provided against the molecular-kinetic conception of heat.\n\nExperimental verification of the theory was made a few years later by Jean Perrin — atoms and molecules were here to stay."

    "text": "Walking on a Lattice\nTo introduce modelling with random walks, we’ll go back to the coin toss example we started with. This is an example of a lattice walk, in this case a 1D lattice.\nWe define the walk as a sequence of n independent integers a_n, each with equal probability of being either -1 or 1. Then we define the series \\{ S_n \\}, where\n S_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_n}, \nas the random walk. In the simulation below, 100 walks are made with n = 20 steps. The final positions of the walkers are recorded in the histogram, which gives us a starting point for investigating the statistical properties of the lattice walk.\n\n\nClick to start. The walkers move along the horizontal axis, with their paths being tracked in time on the vertical axis and their final positions recorded in the histogram.\n\nNote that no walkers land on odd numbers. Why is that?\n\n[FIGURE UNDER REPAIR]\n\nA number of runs should show that despite each walker taking its own route, the result of many walkers tends toward the same result: a normal distribution. I won’t derive that distribution here, but fundamentally its normality is due to the central limit theorem.\nAll good, but for any physical system we’re trying to model (e.g. Brown’s jittery pollen grains) we need to find something to relate the individual walkers to something we can physically observe. The obvious place to start is the question: how far do the walkers get after a certain time, or n steps?\nThe mean value \\langle a_n \\rangle of any single step is zero, and by addition we find the the mean, or expectation, value of the walk,\n \\langle S_n \\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\\langle a_i \\rangle} = 0. \nThis we might expect, as with each step having equal probability of going either way the most probable distance travelled after a number of steps will be zero — back where the walker started. So in this case the mean displacement is not useful to us.\nNext we might look at the squared distance travelled. This proves more useful as (-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1, so \\langle a_n^2 \\rangle = 1. Then\n \\langle S_n^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\\langle a_i^2 \\rangle} +\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\sum_{j \\ne i} 2 \\langle a_i a_j \\rangle = n + 0 = n.\nSo this non-zero  mean squared displacement gives us a more useful statistical quantity to work with."

The diffusion of particles is something we can observe and measure, so now we have a way to check the random walks of a model with reality.\nIn the next simulation, we’ll move up to a 2D lattice, where each walker can move on a plane: up, down, left or right with equal probability. We’ll set off 50 walkers, and keep track of the MSD as we go in a graph.\nThe equation for the diffusion coefficient above tells us we should expect the MSD graph to tend to a straight line as we increase the number of walkers. Then, once the last walker has walked we’ll take a line of best fit through the function from which (by the relation for the diffusion equation above, with d = 2) the slope of the line gives us the diffusion coefficient.\n\n\nClick to start.

By making a good choice of random walks, we can sample huge domains in a systematic way that gives us useful results, without having to check every possible outcome (for example, every way a particle might go). We can then link the theory of microscopic behaviour to macroscopic observables — things we can measure in the lab.\nOne example, Einstein’s model of Brownian motion and Perrin’s measurement, provided crucial evidence for the existence of atoms at the beginning of the last century, something we take for granted now. But as I mentioned, random walks are everywhere in physics, playing an important role in what are known as Monte Carlo simulations."

    "text": "SPQR by Mary Beard — You can only learn things by attaching them to what you’ve already learned, and I hadn’t learned much about a thousand years of Roman history. That said, I got more out of it than expected because Beard’s writing is fun and the book is rarely dry.\nOne thing I do know about is the wood tablets at the fort of Vindolanda at Hadrian’s Wall, because I’ve been to see them at the museum there. When the first tablets were peeled apart and the ink writing discovered, they were rushed to the university at Durham but oxidised before they could be transcribed. The message was thought lost but at the medical school they found they could still read it in the infrared. And they’ve been able to protect many of the rest dug up so you can see them yourself. The tablets include the oldest surviving writing in Latin by a woman, an invitation to a birthday party. I recommend a visit.\nThe Hunt for Red October by Tom Clancy — I always picture Jack Ryan as Alec Baldwin.\nThe Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri ★ — A sweeping but intimate novel that starts in 1960s Calcutta with two young brothers, Subhash and Udayan. Their lives fork, an impulsive Udayan caught up in the Naxalite movement at home and a studious Subhash setting out for university and a life in New England. It’s about staying and leaving, about parenthood, loss, guilt and responsibility, through four generations of a family.\nEndurance by Alfred Lansing ★ ↻ Lansing wrote this authoritative account of the Endurance expedition, having got hold of most of the diaries kept on the voyage and then interviewed the surviving crew. The mission of the great explorer to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic went awry when the tallship got stuck in the icepack of the Weddell Sea, was crushed and sank leaving the crew without a hope.\nThere’s no way to condense the ordeals and suffering the book details. It is unfathomable that they survived. After all that they’d endured over a year, Shackleton took a few men in the tiny open boat James Caird and navigated 800 miles over the most deadly ocean on the planet to hit their only hope of rescue, the speck of South Georgia island. Once there, they had to climb over the sawtooth mountains and glaciers of the interior to get to the whaling station, that itself a route nobody had survived attempting. Shackleton then went back to rescue every one of his crew.\nFrank Hurley shot early colour photographs and got the film home. They are beautiful.\nRagtime by E.L. Doctorow\nThe Carter of La Providence by Georges Simenon (Maigret #4) — Simenon is great at writing canals, as most other things.\nThe Innovators by Walter Isaacson — A history of the people who invented computers, microprocessors, software and the web, from Ada Lovelace to Larry Page. Each character in the story is met only briefly, because many people contributed.\nAnd that’s really the theme of the book. We still have this notion of looking for lone genius inventors when in fact innovation since the last century has driven by brilliant thinkers in collaboration and many incremental advances.\nChristianity by Linda Woodhead — It’s strange when I read histories of Christianity having spent my childhood in one branch of it. Things I think I know well seen from a different angle. In fact though she covers most churches, Woodhead doesn’t mention JWs.\nMost interesting in this brief review was to read about the early divide in church versus biblical Christianity. Also the role of mystical Christianity and the Catholic church’s successful absorption of the monastic movement to bring it under its own control.\nDeep Work by Cal Newport ★ ↻ This book felt important, and I just counted the number of passages I’ve added to my notes from it: 94, which is maybe a record. This is close enough to the central thesis:\n\nThe ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\n\nAnd this from a section on life satisfaction:\n\nMost people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most people have this wrong. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\n\nThe Yellow Dog (Maigret #6) by Georges Simenon — A typical Maigret setting of a murder and a conspiratorial group of men in a small French town, this time Concarneau. Maigret sorts it all out with a few frothy beers of course.\nCities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy — The last in the Border Trilogy brings John Grady Cole and Billy Parham together soon after the Second World War, in work on a ranch. The Old Testament Cities of the Plain were Sodom and Gomorrah, so we know the old world is in fire and brimstone. They make the crossing of the Rio Grande once more to find the last of it. As always McCarthy writes horses better than women.\n\nThe man smiled at him a sly smile. As if they knew a secret between them, these two. Something of age and youth and their claims and the justice of those claims. And of their claims upon them. The world past, the world to come. Their common transciencies. Above all a knowing deep in the bone that beauty and loss are one.\n\nAlso this, from the New York Times review:\n\nThat brief moment between a culture’s existence and extinction – this is the border that McCarthy’s characters keep crossing and recrossing, and the one story, as he’s forever writing, that contains all others. Throughout the trilogy, we keep encountering witnesses – former revolutionaries, priests, gypsies – in whose testimony alone human history survives. As in Proust, the storytellers are inseparable from their tales.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War by Helen Graham — I’m putting together a reading pile on the Spanish Civil War, and I like these short intros for a place to start. I’d never considered that there’s no Civil War museum, though maybe in Barcelona soon. Francoists “always referred to the war as a ‘crusade’ or ‘fight for national liberation’”. A reminder how quickly people can turn to killing their own neighbours, even relatives, when scared and told these people are the danger. Britain’s non-intervention.\n\nThe military coup unleashed what was in effect a series of culture wars: urban culture and cosmopolitan lifestyles versus rural tradition, secular against religious; authoritarianism against liberal political cultures; centre versus periphery; traditional gender roles versus the ‘new woman’; even youth against age, since generational conflicts were also present.\n\nNew culture war, same as the old culture war.\nMen Without Women by Ernest Hemingway — This second set of stories was published in 1927. It’s the one with Hills Like White Elephants and The Killers. The stories flow through the gaps, and you know he’s reporting life where he’s seen it, whether bullfighting in The Undefeated, boxing in Fifty Grand or war on the Italian Front in Now I Lay Me and In Another Country.\nIn an interview, later:\n\nI can remember feeling so awful about the first war that I couldn’t write about it for ten years,” he said, suddenly very angry. “The wound combat makes in you, as a writer, is a very slow-healing one. I wrote three stories about it in the old days—‘In Another Country,’ ‘A Way You’ll Never Be,’ and ‘Now I Lay Me.’\n\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt ★ — This and The Secret History are two of the most enjoyable novels I can remember reading in a long time. Recommended by everyone, and now by me.\n\nCaring too much for objects can destroy you. Only–if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?\n\nWind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry — Saint-Ex wrote this memoir of his daring adventures as an early aviator for the French Aéropostale, expanding into his thoughts on friendship, death and living a meaningful life. He was a pioneer of the mail routes over the Sahara and the Andes. In undependable aircraft, over mountain terrain with navigation by landmarks on the ground or the stars at night, this was a perilous occupation.\n\nNothing, in truth, can ever replace a lost companion. Old comrades cannot be manufactured. There is nothing that can equal the treasure of so many shared memories, so many bad times endured together, so many quarrels, reconciliations, heartfelt impulses. Friendships like that cannot be reconstructed. If you plant an oak, you will hope in vain to sit soon under its shade. For such is life. We grow rich as we plant through the early years, but then come the years when time undoes our work and cuts down our trees. One by one our comrades deprive us of their shade, and within our mourning we always feel now the secret grief of growing old.\n\nOpen by Andre Agassi — The interesting thing about Agassi’s story is he hated his sport. Emmanuel Agassi, an Iranian Olympic boxer migrated to Las Vegas, decided his son would be a tennis pro before he was born. Rigged up a machine to fire balls at a toddler thousands of times a day and sent him on to academies. In Andre’s telling, by the time he got to decide what he wanted to do he only had one option, one he didn’t want. Even when that job got him rich, famous and married to Brooke Shields.\nOnly when things fell apart, he got a ban for crystal meth and dropped to the bottom did Agassi get to enjoy tennis. The rise from there back to world number one late in his career is the real sporting life.\nRunning with the Kenyans by Adharanand Finn — Finn moves for six months to the marathon capital of the world, a town in Kenya called Iten. He hopes to find out what makes the locals worldbeaters at distance running. Running miles to school every day? Running barefoot? Ugali? Altitude? Attitude? And of course it’s a bit of all of that. Except the barefoot running, Kenyans wear trainers.\nHidden City by Karl Whitney — I got this book about Dublin from Daunt before visiting in August, but it’s more a book for locals seeking out obscure bits of their city. Whitney explores underground rivers, ghost towns hit by the financial crash, sewage systems and bus networks. Luckily I can happily read about infrastructure all day, I don’t know why.\nThe Green Road by Anne Enright — Picked up from the great Irish fiction section of Chapters in Dublin. We have a family on the west coast of Ireland, Rosaleen and her children.\n\nHe did not seem happy, he seemed a bit impatient but, That is because I am well, Constance thought, I have been wasting his time with my robust good health, I have been wasting everyone’s time! Her clever body had been doing a great job. Complex. Microscopic. Quiet. The map of light that was her left breast was not frightful but beautiful, and the marbled black and white of its sonic depths was lovely too.\n\nConstance stays and the others go off to New York and Mali. We hear the separate stories of them, and then they’re brought back together.\n\nShe had not thought it would be dark, not yet, the way the Atlantic sky held the light for so long after the sun was down, something to do with the height of the heavens out here on the green road. The west was still open and clear, but the ground under her feet was tricky enough. All the colour was going from things and nothing was easy to see. You could not tell grey from grey.\n\nA Crime in Holland by Georges Simenon\nThe Grand Banks Café by Georges Simenon\nThe Undercover Economist Strikes Back by Tim Harford — The sequel to his tour of microeconomics, this one covers macro, with a bit of the life of Bill Phillips and his MONIAC hydraulic computer.\nWe learn about failures of supply like the ‘prison-camp recession’ and failures of demand like the ‘babysitting co-op recession’, and that in practice it’s hard to tell which is happening. So in response, short-run Keynes, long-run classical is a rule of thumb. It then covers inflation, printing money, GDP, and there’s a chapter explaining how independent central banks committed to low inflation work as Dr Strangelove-like doomsday devices. Having them should mean we don’t have to use them, but it was the ECB’s device that went off in Greece.\nA History of the World by Andrew Marr — I don’t know why after SPQR I’ve gone for another history book covering such a mad amount of time but I liked the style of Marr’s History of Modern Britain so thought I’d like this one too. The time spent on non-European histories was most useful for me, particularly what was going on in China relative to what was happening with Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Also the Americas and Russia. I should read some Tolstoy.\nMarr makes no apology for it being a history of significant individuals but doesn’t always convince me that someone else would not have come along with the same idea. Watt and his steam engine for one example, or Ghandi’s Salt March. In some cases it is clear that one person moved the world in a certain direction, like Zimmermann with his Telegram and most significantly Genghis Khan.\nThe Vital Question by Nick Lane ★ — Lane takes us through a radical, wide-ranging new theory on the origins of life and then complex life. The theory puts energy right at the centre of the problem with the sort of derivation from first principles you get in physics. So I enjoyed that.\n\nThe energy we gain from burning food in respiration is used to pump protons across a membrane, forming a reservoir on one side of the membrane. The flow of protons back from this reservoir can be used to power work in the same way as a turbine in a hydroelectric dam.\n\nIt starts with a search for the sort of consistent energy gradients needed to kick things off. He rules out lightning (not enough) and UV radiation (too destructive) but reveals one candidate on Earth with the right conditions: those hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean.\n\nExactly the kind of dissipative structures that we seek: continuous flow, far-from-equilibrium electrochemical reactors.\n\nOnce simple life is sorted we find out how, after two billion years with nothing but bacteria and archea, eukaryotes (complex life like animals and plants) branched off with one extremely rare event when a bacterium got inside an archea (the rare thing is that they didn’t both immediately die) and formed a nucleus with a mitochondria power plant. Why that was so revolutionary: single-cell organisms have a limit on how big they can get while bringing in enough energy to support themselves, because the energy throughput of the membrane is limited by surface area, which increases squared as the volume increases cubed.\nThe rest of the book takes the idea on to why complex life is like it is: sex, ageing, disease, death. There’s a lot of biology terms through the book, which left me needing the glossary or lost in an argument. He’s good at recapping though so I stopped being bothered about that, just skipping on to catch up.\nThe Marches by Rory Stewart — A journal of long walks in the borderlands between England and Scotland. The first, along Hadrian’s Wall, he takes with his 89-year-old father, comparing the end of Roman Empire with retreat of British Empire, which in the Malayan Civil Service and MI6 his father saw firsthand. The second is a meandering walk from Cumbria to Crieffe, investigating what it means to live in the middleland, and how firm the boundaries really are.\n\nWhile the people hereabouts (and a good way north) have over the past 2,000 years spoken Cumbrian, Welsh, Latin, Northumbrian, Norman French and Borders English, they have never spoken Scottish Gaelic and never called this place Alba.\n\nGrave New World by Stephen D. King — A look at the retreat of globalisation and return of nationalists over the last couple of years, and where this could take us.\nKillers of the Flower Moon by David Grann ★ — This is a shocking, tragic crime history from 1920s Oklahoma. The sisters in a family of the Osage tribe of Native Americans, rich from oil strikes on the rocky land they’d been shoved onto, started dying off. The surviving family have to pay for the new federal Bureau of Investigation to pull together a band to find the murderers and the conspiracy protecting them."

Why do I want that? The two-step method requires two initial points. The second point is often calculated using a Euler step, but as the Euler method is \\mathcal{O(h^1)} I want to make this first step small to avoid introducing a large global error. The third point is then calculated with the Adams-Bashforth method with different step sizes. From then on the Adams-Bashforth method can be used as usual. Another use might be in an adaptive stepsize method, where we want to adjust the stepsizes as we go."

How small should we make it?\nWe’ll use the test ODE system exp as above but this time keep the main stepsize fixed at h = 10^{-2}.

    "text": "Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari — A wide-lens look at human history, particularly at biology and culture. One of the most interesting arguments is that the agricultural revolution promoted huge population growth, and was thus successful for the species, but made the lives of individual homo sapiens worse than when they had been hunter gatherers. The same claim may be made for the industrial revolution. Once such an upheaval has happened there’s no way back.\nRolling Blackouts by Sarah Glidden — Two youngish American journalists tour Turkey, Syria and Iraq, looking for stories. Glidden, the author and cartoonist of this graphic novel, tags along to document the trip. So does another friend, a former US marine who served in Iraq and has his own view on things. It’s poignant to read the stories of Iraqi families who found refuge in Syria, realising that in the time since this was written their lives have no doubt been in danger and turmoil all over again.\nSilence by Erling Kagge — Not a deep read, but reminded me that one of the great benefits of long distance running or walking is spending time in your own head.\nEverything and More by David Foster Wallace — A history of infinity, in particular the work of Georg Cantor. Wallace tries to cut down on the amount of repetition in mathematical writing with a lot of abbreviations, but I found this slowed down the reading rather than help. The book claims to be readable without some background in maths. As in the case of Penrose’s The Road to Reality I think even if that were true it would not be a fun read. If you’ve studied some mathematical foundations, I recommend.\nSeveneves by Neal Stephenson — I’ve long thought if I ever got into sci-fi, I’d get into it hard. This might be the book to do it. Saying that, the first two of the three parts are the ones I really enjoyed and they’re the ones that are set in the near future with some nice thinking about orbital mechanics. The third part, the real sci-fi bit, took a while for me to see the point of.\nJanesville by Amy Goldstein ★ — The modern history of one industrial city in Wisconsin. Janesville was the home of the Parker pen company and had the oldest General Motors factory in the US until it closed in 2008. The book follows a few of the residents affected by the plant closure over the following five years. These characters make concrete the problems of deindustrialisation: how tough it to lose the job you thought would be for life, how tough it is to retrain, to commute huge distances or move when property prices plummet.\n12 Rules for Life by Jordan B. Peterson — Like any self-help book, there’s some obvious stuff here that could be useful. Useful to me maybe. “Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping”, sure. Society is full of Pareto distributions, sure. Be ready for a lot of Old Testament. Among the weirdness, there’s a bit where his example of good parenting is his ability to pin down a two year old.\nDaniels’ Running Formula by Jack Daniels — Training plans from 800m to marathon with useful details on physiology, nutrition and recovering from injuries. The latter became the most important chapter this time as I got crocked halfway through a marathon programme.\nOctober by China Miéville — A narrative look at the Russian Revolution between February and October 1917. There’s a lot of bureaucracy that is key to the story (so many committees) and it’s hard to make that interesting even for a storyteller like Miéville. His own politics must be considered, including admiration of Lenin, but he’s open about it.\nAurora by Melanie Windridge — This is a combination of a travelogue around Canada, Iceland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway (northern parts of the world where the auroral oval can be seen) and a pop science explainer. Windridge is a plasma physicist and does the explaining well. I thought I roughly understood the mechanism: solar wind hits magnetosphere, solar wind particles excited. I was close but wrong.\nHere’s how I understand it after reading the book. Solar wind is plasma with a frozen-in magnetic field. The direction of the field can be pointing north or south as the sun spins and blasts out coronal mass ejections. When the solar wind hits the magnetosphere, the plasma is diverted around the Earth, and its frozen-in magnetic field is draped around the magnetosphere. There’s a clustering of field lines on the upstream (sun-side) of Earth, 60,000 km above the equator. If fields pointing in opposite directions are pushed close enough together, the field plasma can break down and the magnetic configuration can change: field lines break and reconnect. There’s tension in the plasma, and the reconnection catapults plasma particles away and down the field lines. Energy is transferred from the field to the particles as they are accelerated to high speed. The particles collide with the upper atmosphere and its the atmospheric particles that are excited. So the aurora happens at the bottom of the field lines.\nI also learnt which transitions cause the different colours of the aurora and why they’re banded by height. Greens and reds are both transitions of oxygen. The decay lifetime of the green excitation is around a second, the red excitation lifetime is about two minutes. If there’s a collision with another molecule before the excited molecule has time to decay, the energy will be lost as heat and there won’t be colour emission. So the green transition is more common than the red. Also the red aurora tends to appear above 200 km (where there are fewer molecules to bump into) and the green aurora are lower at around 150 km. Pink and purple colours are due to transitions of nitrogen that have much shorter decay times and can be seen below 100 km.\nA Small Town in Germany by John le Carré — I’ve been meaning to try a le Carré book for a while, and was immediately hooked on this one. Something between a spy novel and a mystery set in Bonn in the 60s.\nSo Good They Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport ★ — ‘Follow your passion’ is terrible advice.\nEmpire by Stephen Howe — Howe splits empires into those on land and those of sea. Land empires being those that grew by overland expansion, extending frontiers, like the Roman or the Ottoman. We maybe don’t even think of the ones that still exist as being empires, like the Russian, Chinese or American. The sea power empires are the European kind of the last 500 years, the ones that really spread over the globe. The book mostly focusses on these, the impact and aftermath of that imperialism.\n\nThe economic balance sheet of colonialism, for both imperialist and colonized countries, presents a hugely complex, mixed record: one over which economic historians have long disputed, and will continue to do so. […] In some, indeed, all the preconditions for future commercial and industrial dynamism were present, as in India with its huge production of textiles. Colonial rule destroyed these conditions where they existed, and blocked the possibility of their emerging elsewhere. Colonized areas were forced into acting as sources of underpriced raw materials for European industry and of cheap, often forced or enslaved, labour. They were not allowed to develop industries of their own, except in the few cases where this suited European needs.\n\nHow to Be Miserable by Randy J. Paterson — I picked this up after watching CGP Grey’s short video, which I bet sold a lot of copies. Here’s Grey:\n\nAim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail. Last, but most important, follow your instincts. Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy, for there is a dark magnetic field that points the compass of your impulses in the right direction once you get started. You will want to stay indoors, you will want to not exercise, you will want to sleep in, you will want to do what you know will make you sadder after you’ve done it.\n\nThe Bridge by Geert Mak — The fifth, current, Galata Bridge is not architecturally interesting but its location and history are remarkable. And the memory of walking over it has stuck with me: a city of its own with its fishermen, street sellers, pickpockets and hustlers.\nOrhan Pamuk writes of the bridge in The Museum of Innocence but I wondered who else had. The reason this book is a great read is that Mak spent the time to get the stories of the characters who make the bridge home and passes these stories on with empathy.\nWhy I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge {% include dash.html %} Eddo-Lodge says the title of this book comes from\n\nThe gulf of an emotional disconnect that white people display when a person of colour articulates their experience. You can see their eyes shut down and harden. It’s like treacle is poured into their ears, blocking up their ear canals. It’s like they can no longer hear us.\n\nThere were plenty of times reading the book I felt that disconnect, felt the awkwardness of having to think about how that experience differs from mine. I spend close to zero time thinking about what it means to be white. Recommended.\nCall for the Dead by John Le Carré — After A Small Town in Germany I went back to the first of the Smiley novels.\nA Murder of Quality by John Le Carré — The second Smiley novel is a murder thriller.\nThe Spy Who Came In from the Cold by John Le Carré — The third Smiley novel is back to espionage and to East Germany. OK, this one is really great.\nThe Mixer by Michael Cox — A history of the Premier League in tactics, this starts by emphasising how much the back pass rule changed football. It stopped teams (notably Liverpool) using the back pass to kill games off when ahead. Defenders had to improve technically and goalkeepers had to become footballers. More exciting, especially on television.\nCantona changes forward play, after which every team wants a foreign, mercurial number 10. Most are forgettable but then there’s Zola and Bergkamp. Arsené Wenger arrives, asking his chairman if fans would tolerate two foreign players in the team. Then the sprinter-finishers, Owen and Anelka. Reacting, clubs now need defenders to be fast too. Vialli lines up a Chelsea team with no British players.\nEnglish tactics still lag European leagues, but Alex Ferguson picks it up as United get better in the Champions league. He not only built different champion teams but also derived at least three entirely different strategies to get ahead of the league. Arsené built the Invincibles. Later, Mourinho and Benitez, similar in background and in their reactive play, study hours of video and adapt each game to target opponents’ weaknesses. Their introduction in the same season lowered scoring rates in the league. Then possession football, false nines, inverted wingers and assisters. Finally the pressers, Pochettino and Klopp. Defenders had to attack, now attackers have to defend.\nFootball is never still. As soon as a winning strategy emerges, counterstrategies arrive to beat it. They usually arrive from abroad. I read this during the World Cup. The combination might be enough to get me interested in football again after years of only paying attention to the Reds.\nEnlightenment Now by Steven Pinker — The world is getting worse. Things were better in the past. The current order is broken and corrupt. A revolution is required. If people are hurt in that revolution, it’s for the greater ideological good. Facts are not facts. Wading through the daily swamp of Brexit, Trumpism and Corbynism, modern populism can sound a lot like apocalyptic religion.\nPinker makes a restatement of the case for the Enlightenment values of reason, science and humanism. In the first part he takes measures of human wellbeing (health, wealth, safety, the environment, peace, equal rights, etc.) a chapter at a time and looks at long term positive trends. Where I do not follow Pinker’s optimism is climate change. He doesn’t look closely enough at how and why the opportunity to decarbonise energy early was missed. The result is already disastrous and may well be catastrophic.\nThe Looking Glass War by John Le Carré — Up to the fourth Smiley novel now. Le Carre’s world of Cold War espionage is dark, messy and psychological. His spies are not just fallible but self-interested and often mediocre. Good plot.\nHackers and Painters by Paul Graham — Graham is the co-founder of Y Combinator. This collection of essays are from his blog so I’ve read some of them before. Some interesting examples are Why Nerds are Unpopular, The Hundred Year Language and How to Make Wealth. The writing is good and editing tight, but they’re mostly humourless. The ones on programming langauges are best. For a rebuttal to the title essay, see that other programmer, painter and solid writer Maciej Cegłowski.\nTriumph of the City by Edward L. Glaeser ★ — I’ve lived most of my adult life in the centre of cities, not by accident. Harvard urban economist Edward Glaeser here makes the case for urban life. First, on the agglomeration effects that have made cities hubs of productivity through history.\n\nSilicon Valley and Bangalore remind us that electronic interaction won’t make fact-to-face contact obsolete. The computer industry, more than any other sector, is the place where one might expect remote communication to replace person-to-person meetings.\n\nThere’s a chapter that looks at the decline of industrial cities, with an interesting observation on what made those cities vulnerable.\n\nThe industrial town was unlike either those old commercial cities or the modern capitals of the information age. Its vast factories employed hundreds of thousands of relatively unskilled workers. Those factories were self-sufficient and isolated from the world outside, except that they were providing the planet with vast quantities of cheap, identical products.\n\nSome cities have tried to build themselves back to success, which Glaeser argues is getting things the wrong way around. In fact, bulldozing might be a better, if unpopular, strategy.\n\nLeipzig is worthy of emulation less for its cultural strategy than for its hard headed policy of accepting decline and reducing the empty housing stock. In 2000, one fifth of the city’s homes stock was vacant, a total of 62,500 homes. Bulldozing vacant homes reduces the cost of city services, eliminates safety hazards, and turns decaying eyesores into usable space. Leipzig set a target of destroying 20,000 vacant units.\n\nThe visibility of poverty in cities can give people the idea cities cause poverty but this is wet streets cause rain thinking.\n\nCities can be places of great inequality; they attract some of the world’s richest and poorest people. Although poverty can accompany urban decline, poverty often shows that a city is functioning well. Cities attract poor people because they’re good places for poor people to live.\n\nMaybe we should be more concerned about the cities where we don’t see poverty.\n\nThe absence of poor people in an area is a signal that it lacks something important, like affordable housing or public transportation or jobs for the least skilled.\n\nLiving in a city is far better for the environment than living in the countryside. I’ve learnt that people are surprised when you tell them this and can get offended if they have moved out to a shire and think they’re saving the planet because they drive once a month to an organic farmers’ market in a diesel.\nWhat makes a succesful city? The book concludes with the standout example of Singapore, which provides a high quality of life and plenty of wealth for its citizens without having much in the way of natural resources. The drivers are a remarkably competent public sector and decades-long focus on education.\n\nEducation is, after January temperature, the most reliable predictor of urban growth.\n\nEnergy by Richard Rhodes — An ambitious and detailed trip through 400 years of human energy production from wood burning through coal, oil, petrol, nuclear and renewable energy sources, looking at innovation and the impact on society and the environment.\nThere are some great historical notes. I thought I knew well the story of Stephenson’s first passenger railway from here in Manchester to Liverpool, but there is good detail on the ingenuity of floating the tracks over the swamp of Chat Moss and the invested interests Stephenson fought, from canal owners, carriage companies and wealthy landowners. The Earl of Sefton sent secret death threats, letting Stephenson know he’d have him thrown in a lake if he persisted in taking the railway through Sefton’s estates.\nA Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson — I read a bunch of Bryson’s travel books in 2015 but put this one off partly because I knew it’d just put in my head the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail and that’s not a small thing to have in your head. It’s about 3,500 km long, it’d take months. Anyway, now I want to walk the Appalachian Trail.\nWorth Dying For by Tim Marshall — A world tour of national flags, and some others. There’s a bit of history on each and some interesting facts, like the eight places the Stars and Stripes is authorised to fly 24 hours a day, how Nato HQ rotates its flags every Sunday, and that the night sky shown in the Brazil flag is just as it would have been observed in Rio de Janeiro on 15 November 1889 at the time the monarchy was taken down.\nThere’s brief mentions of how flags are used to unite and divide, including how the St George’s Cross gets co-opted by the far right in Britain and why the Confederate flag is still flown in the Southern US. But mostly it’s an interesting light read.\nFavourite flags? South Korea, Barbados, Seychelles, Brazil, Vietnam. And Nepal because yeah, enough rectangles.\nMadness Visible by Janine di Giovanni ★ — I made trips to Slovenia and Croatia this year, both beautiful, modern EU states. I picked this up in a bookshop in Dubrovnik: Di Giovanni’s memoir of the Balkan Wars, which she covered on the ground for The Times. It’s a harrowing firsthand account of the devestating reality of murder, torture and ethnic cleansing from Sarajevo, Kosovo, Pristina. Di Giovanni avoids political judgements, focusing on reporting war from the perspective of its victims.\nIt’s a reminder of the extreme danger faced by war correspondents. Subscribe to a newspaper that pays foreign correspondents or there’ll be nobody there to report on such atrocities."

    "text": "The Manchester Accountants League plays Sunday football at Hough End Playing Fields, a vast grid of twenty or so muddy, bumpy pitches in a park in Withington. A few years ago I played for a newly-formed pub team based at the Rising Sun, just off Deansgate. Other teams in the league included Maccabi, a Jewish team, Mesopotamians, all players from Iraq, and, a division above us, Village Manchester, relatively famous for their success in IGLFA World Championships. The ‘accountants’ bit of the name is an anachronism. The football, at least when I played, was more agricultural than actuarial.\nOne of the referees of the league’s matches was remarkably advanced in years — we didn’t know how old but guessed he could’ve been eighty. He was good-humoured but dead serious about his work, tall and spindly. He hardly moved on the pitch, staying in the centre circle to watch the game from there and only mobilising for important events like corners.\nI never understood why anyone would want to get up on Sunday mornings to take verbal abuse from twenty-two angry, hungover Mancunians who think they’re better at football than they are. Me included. The pay was a token £25 for two hours work and travel. Some people obviously love the game enough though, including this old feller still standing out in the rain and wind when he could reasonably have been at home doing crosswords.\nWe thought he was funny, and respect for his age meant he didn’t seem to get as much abuse as the other officials. This despite the fact that he seemed to have quite unique ideas on how the game should be adjudicated. I remember one game of ours he was doing when two players went into a tackle and the ball went out off their man for a throw-in. Both players claimed it, he gave it to the opposition and our player made a comment he didn’t like. As punishment, to everyone’s bemusement, he upgraded the award to a direct freekick on the edge of our area. I was near him and said ‘Listen, you can’t just turn throw-ins into freekicks. That’s not a rule.’ He replied ‘There are no rules in football, just laws, and I’m the judge and executioner.’ Well, what do you say to that.\nI only played for that team for one season as I got fed up of having my knees hacked at by lumbering defenders who preferred that approach over chasing after me. A few months after I’d stopped playing, I turned on the sports news one morning to see the old guy there on the screen. Mr Thomas ‘Tommy’ Clarke was, they said, the oldest FA referee in the country, at 86. In the entire league pyramid, from Manchester Accountants Division Two to the Premier League, the oldest.\nAnother funny decision Tommy Clarke made went our way. After the other team took a corner the ball broke and a teammate of mine, Chris, set off on a counterattack, dribbling into their half. I caught up alongside him and just as he went to slide the ball to me, a defender took him down from behind. It was a hilariously filthy foul. He was, I considered, the last defender and should’ve been sent off. The referee blew a distant whistle and, when he finally made it up to our end of the pitch, pointed to the penalty spot. Their defenders were outraged. The thing was, the foul wasn’t in the penalty area. Chris’s forward momentum hadn’t even carried him into the D, as was obvious from the long furrow he’d made through the mud after being felled. It stopped about 25 yards from goal. After wailing at the ref, the defenders turned on us, telling us to own up: that it was outside the box and we knew it. We were laughing too hard even if we wanted to tell him, which we didn’t. We told them where to go. We hadn’t won a game in the league yet, we were having that. The penalty levelled the match.\nI looked up the oldest referee to see if he was still out on Hough End on Sunday mornings. Turns out not. He retired the following season, blowing his last whistle at the age of 87, and died a couple of years later in 2009. His death was reported in the Manchester Evening News, who claimed that Mr Clarke was in fact the oldest referee in the world. I don’t know how you’d check that. But either way he’d apparently been refereeing games since 1948, which is amazing. It even quoted the exact words he said to me after that freekick decision, wisdom he apparently gave out often.\nThinking again about the penalty, perhaps Tommy Clarke knew exactly what he was doing. Maybe he’d seen the whole thing and just pretended to have been too far away. It says in that report that he’d only brandished four red cards in his whole career. Maybe he didn’t want to send the lad off but decided a penalty was sufficient punishment for a goal-preventing foul. Not in the rules, but a reasonably fair outcome if you think about it. ‘There are no rules in football, just laws, and I’m the judge…’\nAn honour to have been refereed by you, Mr Clarke. It was definitely our throw."

    "text": "This is part two in a series presenting some of the kinds of systems you can model with MaxwellBloch, a scientific Python package I developed to model the propagation of light through thermal quantised systems like atomic vapours. In part one we looked at how you can make light go faster than the speed of light using anomalous dispersion. Some of the basics of the propagation model are covered there so I recommend reading that first.\nOne thing I mentioned in that post was that to get the dispersion we wanted for fast group velocity, we had to deal with high absorption. They always come together in the linear system due to a mathematical relation between them. But strong absoprtion, if you can’t control it, can be a problem in designing quantum optical technology. If all your light gets absorbed as soon as it hits the atoms you can’t do much with it. Which brings us to asking whether there’s a way to get light to travel through a highly dispersive medium without the absorption."

    "section": "Self-induced Transparency",
    "text": "Self-induced Transparency\nYou probably guessed I was going to say that there is: it’s called self-induced transparency. You need a strong, short pulse that has a certain shape. First in figure 1 we’ll look at a pulse that doesn’t have the right shape – it isn’t a big enough pulse.\n\n\n\n\nFig 1 — Propagation of a 0.8π pulse through a two-level medium. Notebook.\n\n\n\nThe blue region represents a large number of two-level atoms that have a transition on resonance with the frequency of the light pulse, and we see that the pulse is quickly absorbed and scattered. In figure 2 we see a bigger pulse that has the right sort of shape moving through the same atom region.\n\n\n\n\nFig 2 — Propagation of a 1.8π pulse through a two-level medium. Notebook.\n\n\n\nThis time the pulse is adjusted as it hits the atoms, but it doesn’t actually lose any energy and leaves the back of the atom region at the right just as it came in from the left. What happens here is that as the pulse moves through the atoms, the light intensity is just enough to excite each atom to its excited state and then down again via stimulated emission to the ground state. This all happens within the phase memory of the atoms.1\nI mentioned that the pulse shape is important – specifically it is the pulse area given by\n\n\\theta(z)  = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} \\Omega(z, t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\nthat is critical, where \\Omega is the pulse Rabi frequency, which is related to the intensity of the light pulse – it’s what is shown on the y-axis of these plots.\nIf we have a pulse area less than π, as in figure 1, the pulse is absorbed. For a pulse area bigger than π, the pulse will grow2 to 2π as it moves into the medium and form a specific shape given by\n\n\\Omega_{2\\pi}(z,t) = \\frac{2}{t_s} \\mathrm{sech} \\left( \\frac{t - z/v_g}{t_s} \\right)\n\nwhere \\mathrm{sech} is the hyperbolic secant function, t_s describes the width of the pulse and v_g is its group velocity. If we put in an input pulse with exactly this shape in at the front of the medium, we should see it keep its shape all the way through. This is what happens, as shown in figure 3.\n\n\n\n\nFig 3 — Propagation of a 2π sech pulse through a two-level medium. Notebook.\n\n\n\nThe pulse gets squashed and slowed down a bit as the pulse energy spends some non-zero amount of its time as an excitation in the non-moving medium.\nThe pulse in self-induced transparency is an example of an optical soliton. More on that later. I like to think of the optical soliton like a busy waiter who needs to fight his way through a crowded bar. As he squeezes through he knocks the first patron’s drink. Luckily he’s got quick reactions and catches it before it has time to spill, then turns and bumps straight into the second drinker’s arm. Again he catches the drink, and carries on this way bumping and catching until he reaches the door. Phew. He’s moved through more slowly than if the bar was empty, but just about reached the other side in one piece with nothing spilled."

The first one is narrower and travels faster.3\n\n\n\n\nFig 4 — Propagation of a 4π sech pulse through a two-level medium. Notebook.\n\n\n\nIn figure 5 we put in a 6π pulse. This one breaks up into three. Note that the last two form the same as the 4π resultant pulses and travel at the same speed.\n\n\n\n\nFig 5 — Propagation of a 6π sech pulse through a two-level medium. Notebook."

Unlike ordinary waves, the soliton holds its shape without spreading and can travel along at a fixed speed over large distances. The story of the discovery is well known to physicists – in 1834 the engineer John Scott Russell saw one formed from the bow of a boat on the Grand Union Canal near Edinburgh and chased it down the on his horse for a few miles before deciding it wasn’t going to stop. In the 60s and 70s, researchers in nonlinear optics discovered that solitons may be formed in light pulses, as we’re simulating here, and can be used to send signals down optical fibres over large distances."

    "text": "The United States is a welcoming place. This I knew from previous visits to the New World. Apart from the time they served me something called ‘Biscuits and Gravy’ for breakfast, which turned out to contain neither biscuits nor gravy, I’ve always found Americans to be perfect hosts.\nWhat I wasn’t expecting was that, on our first trip to Washington, me and Livy would get to step into the Oval Office. The actual one. With the desk and the rug and the president and everything. Well, we had to wait until Barack Obama had finished work for the day until we could nose about his place of work, but fair enough.\nI don’t think I’ve been as excited about being somewhere in my life. We were asked not to take photos in the West Wing so I don’t have anything from there to show, but at the time that just made me more determined to get every photon I could into my eyeballs as we pottered around to gaze at the Navy Mess, the Cabinet Room, the Roosevelt Room. And then that room with no corners.\nThe Marine stationed at the door kindly offered that we take one step inside, and I knew better than to ask for a second. From there I tried my best to imprint the image on my retinas — the busts of Martin Luther King and Lincoln, the two pastoral Edward Hoppers behind that hunk of wood from the HMS Resolute saved from the Arctic ice.\n\n\n\n\nThe White House seen from outside the West Wing.\n\n\n\nWe were allowed to take photos in the Press Briefing Room (obviously I pretended I was C.J. Cregg) and outside the building, so here’s a view of the Residence and North Portico from outside the West Colonnade.\nDuring our time in what must be eighteen of the highest-security acres on the planet, we were also invited to walk around the Eisenhower Executive Office Building which sits next door and houses most of the administration staff in its 500-odd offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corridors and staircases of the Eisenhower building are superior to those of the West Wing, which have low ceilings and functional carpets. It’s hard to comprehend that the Eisenhower building was long unloved. Mark Twain declared it ‘the ugliest building in America.’ I guess he hadn’t seen Trump Tower. Having swerved a planned demolition in 1957 to save on maintenance costs, it’s now a National Historic Landmark, so should be safe.\nThat’s all I’ve got from the White House. If the people who made that possible happen to read this — thank you.\n\n\n\n\nNational Gallery of Art, East Building.\n\n\n\nOf course we also popped into some of the amazing Smithsonian National Museums around the Mall: of American History, of Natural History, of the American Indian, of Air and Space, and the National Gallery of Art.\nThere are too many wonderful exhibits to list, but I would say Charles Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis, the Apollo 11 Command Module, the Star-Spangled Banner, Doug Engelbart’s first prototype mouse and Vincent van Gogh’s blue, blue self-portrait stand out as memorable things to stand close to.\n\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Avenue from the Newseum.\n\n\n\nBoth Livy and me particularly enjoyed the Newseum, which features exhibits on the history of journalism, the First Amendment and the technological history of media. A poignant memorial lists the many names of correspondents and photographers killed in the course of their reporting, updated every year.\nThe balcony offers great views along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowhouses in Bloomingdale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuzz Aldrin’s Apollo 11 Spacesuit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stayed with friends in the Bloomingdale neighbourhood to the north of the Capitol Building (which usefully marks the origin of the city’s grid system). The street presents these beautiful Victorian-style rowhouses, which feature on the House of Cards intro if you look close.\nAnd that was the District of Columbia. From Union Station we took the Amtrak back north through Baltimore to New York.\nIt’s not the greenery turning gold in fall, the scenery circling the Mall…"

    "title": "Benchmark String Conversion in C++",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently traced an underperforming routine in a C++ application to the construction of some strings from a stringstream used in this case to convert from an integer. This is a fairly common thing to see as stringstreams are flexible for converting from different types. Here’s an example of the operation I’m talking about.\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n#include &lt;sstream&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n  std::string x(\"prefix \");\n  std::string y;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)\n  {\n    std::ostringstream oss;\n    oss &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; i;\n    y = oss.str();\n  }\n}\nFirst I could see that the stringstream did not need to be constructed in the loop, but also since C++11 we’ve had another way to do this using std::to_string. Here’s the same task done this modern way, without stringstreams.\n#include &lt;string&gt;\n\nint main()\n{\n  std::string x(\"prefix \");\n  std::string y;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)\n  {\n    y = x + std::to_string(i);\n  }\n}\nI expect this to be faster because it requires no construction in the loop and stringstreams are known to be slow, but how much faster? This is an example where I can quickly make and share a benchmark using Quick C++ Benchmark by Fred Tingaud.\n\n\n\n\nThe std::to_string conversion is 4.5× faster.\n\n\n\nThe tool allows you to select different compilers, C++ standards and optimisation levels. It doesn’t support MSVC unfortunately, but Clang and GCC are available.\nIn summary, using to_string is faster here than stringstream conversion and Quick C++ Benchmark is a useful tool for benchmarking C++ code."

    "text": "In January I attended the Harvard ITAMP winter school on ultracold Rydberg physics. The school was held at Biosphere 2, a unique research facility in the desert not far from Tucson. Following the winter school I took a road trip with two friends, Hannes and Henning, up through Arizona and into Utah.\n\n\n\nPhotos from the Utah part of this trip, here.\n\nBiosphere 2\n\n\nThe biosphere was built in the early 90s as a closed experiment to determine what would be needed to set up bases for future space colonisation. Inside the domes are areas for rainforest, ocean, coral reef, wetlands and desert, with the idea of creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Kylie Minogue was not there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince those 90s missions — when groups of scientists were locked in for up to two years at a time — the centre has been an Earth Sciences research laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome bits do look a bit like Center Parcs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur accomodations were these pastel Southwestern-style casitas at the biosphere — simple, comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA forest of cacti on a hike up into the Santa Catalina mountains.\n\n\nRoadtrip Arizona\n\n\nWith the winter school concluded, we picked up a car to drive north through Arizona and into Utah. Arizona alone is bigger than Britain, so there was a fair bit of driving to do. The first day we set off from Tucson through Phoenix up to Sedona.\n\n\n\n\n\nA ruin at Casa Grande national monument, a collection of such structures lived in by a ancient Pueblo peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made it to Sedona and climbed up to Airport Vortex just in time to watch the sun set on the great red sandstone rock formations. Sedona is a beautiful little town with good bars and cafés, full of outdoors shops for hiking, cycling and climbing in the surrounding hills and canyons.\n\n\nVortexes not vortices, who knows why.\n\n\nSedona’s more unusual feature is that it draws in hippies and new-agers who believe the rocks contain ‘spritual power centres’, with the local name of ‘energy vortexes’. So there’s also shops peddling every kind of spiritual nonsense: astrology, palm reading, healing crystals, all that. Even that did little to put me off though, I’d love to go back.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sun goes down behind Cathedral Rock (on the right), seen in silhouette from Airport Vortex.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next morning we hiked up to Devil’s Bridge before leaving Sedona.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe left through Oak Creek Canyon on the scenic 89A state road, which makes an ear-popping climb through hairpin turns up to Flagstaff and then beyond on the plateau. Here we’re looking back at Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at 3,852 metres.\n\n\n\n\nThe Colorado River continues its age-old work of cutting its way through the Grand Canyon. ‘I’d echo everything you say…’ From here we drove into Utah."

    "text": "Šiellajohka\nIn February, I found an unexpected email in my inbox. Just a cryptic question, ‘Do you still have your old backpack?’ It was Niklas, a Swedish friend of mine, and I knew what he was getting at. We’d talked about heading north to see the Scandinavian mountains (Fjällen) back when I lived in Stockholm but never organised it. This time we made the plans and in August I was stood with Nik and the old backpack at Stockholm’s Central Station, ready to make the long journey north.\nOur journey began with an 18 hour sleeper train up country from Stockholm. Departing at 6 in the evening, we studied our maps over beers in the restaurant carriage before settling in to the basic but comfortable cabins to watch the forests and lakes go by the window. Gently rocked by the train we slept well and at noon the next day pulled up in Abisko, a small village at the top of Sweden and the start of our adventure.\nKungsleden (The King’s Trail) is a four hundred kilometre marked route across arctic Sweden, from Abisko at the top down through Lapland, Europe’s last proper wilderness. You can hike it when the snow melts in the late summer or cross-country ski in the winter.\nThe trail is well-maintained and the excellent Svenska Turistföreningen (STF) mountain huts are spaced roughly a day’s walk apart, so it makes a great way to explore this part of the world. But we weren’t taking Kungsleden. ‘A highway for tourists’ says Nik. Kungsleden follows the valleys and we wanted to be up in the mountains and in the wild, so we made use of Sweden’s allmansrätten (right-to-roam) to navigate our own journey through Lapland.\nWe’d meet up with the trail later on at Kebnekaise, Sweden’s highest mountain, to climb to its summit and then continue south to the village of Kvikkjokk, where a once-a-day bus goes to Murjek. From Murjek you can get a local train to Jokkmokk. From Jokkmokk you get back on the the long train down to Stockholm."

Much of the day is a long dawn/dusk, when the blue glaciers seem to glow and the dark jagged mountains are bathed in a pink ethereal light. We hiked at midnight as easily as at noon.\n\n\n\n\nKaskasatjåkka and Niijbáš from Kasakvagge.\n\n\n\n\nCutting our own path through the high mountain passes meant we found perfect isolation, going without seeing another person for up to five days at one point. And of course there’s no phone signal, never mind WiFi, so no inboxes, no news and no noise from the world for a couple of weeks. Just the time to explore a quiet wilderness.\n\n\n\n\nLone tree at Vuomajåkhå.\n\n\n\nTo survive out there we had to carry everything we needed: the tent, stove, food. We each carried about 25 kilos in our backpacks. Our meals had to be basic: porridge or muesli for breakfast, with foraged blueberries to flavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for the rain to stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlueberries for the porridge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDark rye bread for lunch. Nuts, dried apricots and chocolate as we walked. Macaroni cooked on the stove for dinner with a few different dried sauces. Doesn’t sound that exciting, but after a whole day of walking we always enjoyed hot food."

Many times a day we’d come to a wide brimming stream and have to find a place safe enough to jump across stones, or throw our bags to the other side to make a running leap and hope we wouldn’t end up swimming.\n\n\n\n\n\nTjäktiajåkka. Don’t think I’ve swam anywhere colder. Nice for hot and tired feet though.\n\n\n\nHaving so much water around meant we didn’t have to worry too much about carrying litres — it was everywhere, clean and delicious to drink. There’s not much better than a melting arctic glacier to quench a thirst. One afternoon the sun came out and we took a shivery dip in the Tjäktiajåkka river.\nSome days we found comfortable places to camp. Others we had to take what we could find, swiping at clouds of mosquitos in the wet valleys or sleeping on a bed of rocky scree in the uplands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamp 8 at Saltoluokta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamp 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoping to head off the insects with altitude on day 3, we set up camp at 1,350 metres on a narrow ledge over a huge valley. Soon after, we realised this might not be the best place to be as a storm set in. I lay awake all night in the deafening wind sure we were soon to be blown off into the abyss. Nik slept unperturbed.\n\n\n\n\nDuolbagorni.\n\n\n\nThe storm wouldn’t let up in the morning so we broke camp in a raincloud, got lost in the fog and bashed ourselves up a few times scrambling down over miles of huge wet boulders, slipping with heavy packs and landing hard on shins and knees. The other side of being off-grid is that if one of us broke an ankle we’d have to set up camp and then the other would need to walk, possibly for days, to get help. Thankfully we had no serious mishaps.\n\n\n\n\nVisttasjokha, after a night and morning of heavy rain.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon the rain eased and we followed the swollen Visttasjokha river down in its valley, admiring the clouds from below."

At each lake there are three boats. At least one has to stay on each side, so if you take the last one you have to row across, tow one of the other boats back to where you started and row again: three crossings.\n\n\n\n\nRowing over Teusajaure. Two rowboats on our side this time, so we only needed make one crossing.\n\n\n\nThe boats are heavy and designed to be sturdy and stable rather than easy to row, so it could take an hour of rowing each way. We finished those days with tired arms. At one lake, there’s an alternative. Raise a flag on the beach and a local Sami man will come over when he sees it and take you over in a motorboat for 200 SEK (£19).

Many have volunteer hosts (usually outdoorsy retirees) to look after you and sell a few provisions. Some even have saunas, like this one under the waterfall at Teusajaure, though sadly we didn’t have time to stop here.\n\n\n\n\nTeusajaurestugorna.\n\n\n\nAfter an incredible fortnight of solitude hiking over mountains, camping under glaciers, rowing over lakes and swimming in freezing rivers, we finally came down into the tiny hamlet of Kvikkjokk and treated ourselves to a first stay in an STF hut and a bed as we waited for the bus to start the journey home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVälkommen till Kvikkjokks Fjällstation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe train station at Murjek\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally published in Ernest Journal.\nThe man at the hut looked up at us as we limped over, bedraggled. ‘I’ll get you a beer and a sandwich.

For example, did you know you can measure \\pi just by dropping sticks on a table and counting them? This is because \\pi has a role in statistics too. Try it for yourself, and below we’ll visit the story of how this remarkable trick was discovered.\nClick on the board to drop sticks. Each time you click, 100 will be dropped and the number that cross a line will be counted. I dropped 10 to start you off.\nDoes the estimate get better as you drop more sticks (i.e. does the error get smaller)? How close to \\pi can you get after 100,000 sticks or 1,000,000?"

    "text": "Buffon’s Needle\nIn 1777, a French philosopher called Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, wrote out an elegant theorem that turned out to be the earliest problem in geometric probability.\nBuffon discovered that if you draw a set of equally-spaced parallel lines (say, d centimetres apart) and drop sticks on them that are shorter than the spacing (say l centimetres long, where l is less than d) then the probability of a stick crossing a line is\n\\frac{2 l}{\\pi d}.\nThis means that if you drop lots of sticks randomly and count how many cross the parallel lines, you can calculate what \\pi is by rearranging the formula to get\n \\pi = \\frac{2ls}{c d} \nwhere s is the number of sticks you drop and c is the number that crossed a line.\nIsn’t that remarkable? Buffon had worked out that you can calculate \\pi just by dropping a bunch of sticks on a table — no circles required! The problem is known as Buffon’s Needle.\nAs usual in statistics, we want to take a big sample to get an estimate close to the true probability. If I ask 5 people ‘are you left handed?’ and you ask 500 people the same, we know that your bigger sample is likely to give us the better idea of what proportion of people are left handed in the whole country. The same applies here — to get a good sample we need to drop a lot of sticks.\nPerhaps that’s why it took a long time after Buffon’s discovery for somebody to actually try it themselves, but in 1901 the Italian mathematician Mario Lazzarini gave it a go. He span around and dropped over 3,400 sticks onto the floor, counted up the number that crossed over lines and estimated \\pi to be 3.1415929. We know \\pi to be 3.1415927…, so he was correct in the first 6 digits, an error of 0.000006%. That’s good! Suspiciously good in fact, and so improbable that it’s more likely he cheated. Hoist by his own probabilistic petard?"

I’m sure a dizzy Lazzarini would’ve appreciated one. Simulations like this, where we use randomness to give us a sample of results, are called Monte Carlo methods, after the European city famous for its casino.\nMonte Carlo methods are useful in physics as we can model a large system with a huge number of possible states with a much smaller, but representative subset. It has important uses in thermal physics, molecular modelling, astrophysics and weather forecasting. And, as Buffon showed 200 years ago, can even be used to calculate \\pi.\nBuffon may have been the earliest human to discover this result but the natural world might have got there first. A paper in Behavioral Ecology suggests that ants use Buffon’s Needle to determine, before initiating an emigration, if a nest has sufficient area to house their colony.1"

Here we’ll consider the V configuration, where the atom has two excited states, \\left| 1 \\right&gt; and \\left| 2 \\right&gt;, and a single ground state level \\left| 0 \\right&gt; which is coupled to both excited states. The field component resonant with \\left| 0 \\right&gt; \\leftrightarrow \\left| 1 \\right&gt; we’ll call A and the field component resonant with \\left| 0 \\right&gt; \\leftrightarrow \\left| 2 \\right&gt; we’ll call B.\nIf we synchronise the input field envelopes \\Omega_A(z=0, t) and \\Omega_B(z=0, t) such that\n\n\\Omega_B(0, t) = r\\Omega_A(0, t)\n\nfor some constant r, the three-level system in superposition acts like a two-level system and the concept of the area theorem then extends to the pair of field envelopes. If we likewise define the pulse areas of A and B with\n\n\\theta_{\\{A,B\\}}(z) = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} \\Omega_{\\{A,B\\}}(z, t) \\mathrm{d} t\n\nwe can derive a matched pulse area\n\n\\theta'(z) = \\sqrt{\\theta_A^2(z) + \\theta_B^2(z)}\n\nwhere, like a soliton, if the area \\theta'(z) = 2\\pi the pulse can move through the atoms unimpeded. But note here that the area theorem applies to the sum of squares, and looks like the hypotenuse from Pythagora’s theorem. This means we can fix the length of the ‘hypotenuse’ at 2\\pi and make \\theta_A(z) bigger or smaller like the base of the right-angled triangle.\nLet’s see what this looks like. In figure 1 a \\theta_A(z) = 1\\pi pulse in field A approaches from the left and enters a cell of V-configuration atoms represented by the blue region. There is no matched pulse in field B, so the system acts like a two-level system where the pulse does not have enough area to propagate as a soliton. The pulse is quickly absorbed on entry (z = 0) and, apart from some small oscillations, no pulse reaches the back of the medium at the right (z = 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 —  A 1\\pi pulse in field A (green) propagates through a three-level atomic vapour with V-configuration (blue region).\n\n\nIn figure 2 the same \\theta_A(z) = 1\\pi pulse in field A approaches from the left, but this time it is matched with a \\theta_B(z) = \\sqrt{3}\\pi pulse in field B. We see that both pulses travel through the atoms without absorption and are received at the back of the cell on the right with the same profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2 —  A 1\\pi pulse in field A (green) and a \\sqrt{3}\\pi pulse in field B (red) propagate through a three-level atomic vapour with V-configuration (blue region).\n\n\nWe can understand this result by looking at the matched pulse area:\n\n\\theta'(z) = \\sqrt{\\theta_A^2(z) + \\theta_B^2(z)} = \\sqrt{1 + 3}\\pi = 2\\pi.\n\nThe two pulses are able to travel together as one simulton connected by quantum superposition in the three-level atom. Solitons are observed in classical situations, such as water waves, but simultons are a purely quantal phenomenon."

    "text": "Observing Simultons\nThe requirement of matched pulses and equal oscillator strengths, along with some other fairly strict conditions2, made simultons difficult to realise experimentally, and in nearly 40 years since that original prediction they had never been observed in an atomic vapour.\nWhat we were able to show in theory and then in simulations like the ones I’m showing here is that the conditions were too strict. If the pulses aren’t initially matched, the simulton can bring them together. If the couplings have different oscillator strengths, the simulton can hold them together. The different oscillator strengths mean that the propagating pulses don’t match the exact Konopnicki & Eberly definition of a simulton, so in the PRL paper we give the generalised pulses the name quasisimultons to be precise. Here I’ll just call them simultons.\nWe can see this robustness of simulton propagation in figure 3. Two seperate 2\\pi pulses, one in field A (green) and one in field B (red), are shown entering the medium. These each have the pulse area to travel individually as solitons. The A field has a stronger interaction strength3 and so travels slower than the B soliton, which catches it up. When the pulses meet about half way across the medium, they combine. The matched pulse area is now 4\\pi, so the combined pulse breaks up and forms two 2\\pi simultons. Note that the sign of field A has flipped in the later simulton.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3 —  A 2\\pi pulse in field A (green) and a 2\\pi pulse in field B (red) propagate through a three-level atomic vapour with V-configuration (blue region). The A field has a stronger interaction with respect to its transitions than the B.\n\n\nWe also added thermal broadening, spontaneous decay and hyperfine pumping to the simulations, and it was still possible for simultons to form.

The fact that the simulton area theorem applies to the pulses in combination gives us an extra degree of freedom. For example, we might make one field arbitrarily weak, even just a few photons. If we encode quantum information in the polarisation of a photon, we could use a strong pulse in a simulton to transmit it through a material that would otherwise absorb it. Using Rydberg atom interactions, we might then be able to make simultons interact in a controllable way for use in quantum computation."

    "text": "Monday morning conversations with my neighbour Niklas over breakfast have been downcast these past few weeks. ‘How did Djurgården get on this weekend?’, I’ll ask tentatively, over the ever-gurgling kitchen coffee-machine. ‘Not good. We lost again.’ comes the familiar reply, as I stir my tea. ‘How about Liverpool?’. ‘Ah, don’t ask.’\nFinding a Stockholm football team to follow has been a task I’ve put off since my move to Sweden, with plenty else to keep me occupied. Hammarby were the team I’d considered beforehand, but Djurgården turned out to be the local team when I found a place to live. ‘The Blue Stripes’ play at the beautiful old Olympic stadium, built for the 1912 summer games. It sits between my new home in the north of the city and the campus of Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan where I study, so I pass it on my daily walk.\nI often slow down to admire the beautiful brickwork, the clock tower with its battlements and the old telephone boxes outside. You can even see the pitch from the pavement on Valhallavägen, through the main arch of the structure. And it’s close enough to hear the cheers and boos on match days, as a weekly reminder for me to investigate. This season, apparently, there’s been few cheers. At the end of a decade of success for Djurgården — winning Allsvenskan in 2002, 2003 and 2005, along with a bunch of domestic cups — this season has been awful. Not only has their poor form driven them down into the relegation zone, but they’ve had to watch as bitter Stockholm rivals AIK have enjoyed a strong campaign at the top.\nSeventeen losses seemed to have sealed Djurgården’s fate, but a late turn of form and a couple of wins have brought some hope. A vital 2-1 win over the other team facing relegation, Örgryte, was backed up with a surprise 0-2 win at Helsingborg. The match will be remembered as Henrik Larsson’s professional bow, but the importance of the result for the future of Djurgården could be huge. Örgryte have slipped below them into the automatic relegation spot, two points behind with just one game to go.\nStill, Örgryte only have to beat tenth-placed Gefle in their final game, their team probably planning their skiing holidays; Djurgården’s final hurdle is a tough match against fourth-placed Kalmar, who have a Europa League spot to fight for, and against whom they’ve lost their last three home games. There is still a tough job to do.\nMeanwhile, those rivals I mentioned, AIK, sit on top of the league, one point above Göteborg. Remarkably, the fixture list has drawn the old clubs against each other in the final game, with Göteborg holding home advantage. The newspapers, Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter, are calling it the Gold Medal Match. This is the kind of excitement I need to distract me from what looks to be a season already over on Merseyside. I jump at Niklas’ offer to grab me a ticket for Djurgården’s final match.\nSo this Sunday afternoon in November, I meet Niklas and a couple of his friends, and our neighbour Hamza. ‘Aren’t you worried about hooliganism, bringing a Turkish and an English to your nice Swedish football?’, he teases. The match is a sellout: all 13,000 tickets. The news from Gothenburg is that AIK fans are already causing trouble, smashing every window on the SJ train that brought them west. I’ve been on one of those fine old locomotives — I’m building a healthy dislike of AIK already.\nArriving at the stadium, we find our space on the wooden benches. The stands are low, though the running track keeps us a little distant from the action. The club anthem ‘Sing of Old Djurgården’ comes over the speakers and gets a loud recital, which I am actually able to join in as Hamza has dutifully written down the words after finding them on the internet. I’m mostly chortling through it as he surprises me with these carefully copied notes, and I have no idea what I’m singing about, but it is an enjoyable and rousing tune nonetheless.\nKick off! Djurgården start brightly. The full backs get forward, overlapping and flinging some decent crosses in, though the Kalmar keeper has little trouble plucking them out of the air. Though the home team are bossing possession, the importance of the game is clearly causing some tension with a few wayward touches in midfield.\nRelief comes after 27 minutes. A Djurgården corner is headed clear of the box, only for midfielder Patrick Haginge to fire it back goal wards with a sweet half volley low into the bottom right corner of the net. Celebration and hugs all round , on the pitch and in the stands.\nSoon after the goal, a quiet cheer spreads around the ground suggesting good news elsewhere. Örgryte are losing at Gefle. And another, much louder, cheer. Göteborg are 1-0 up against AIK. Niklas confirms my suspicion, ‘AIK losing is probably as important to us as Djurgården winning.’ Half time arrives, and the crowds descend through brick arches to queue for warm Kanelbullar and more coffee, as we hop around to defrost toes. The faces around us are happy — all the important results are going the right way.\nSettling back in for the second half, a little tension seeps back in to the crowd. Örgryte have equalised in their match, and Kalmar have woken up a bit. A few high balls leave the centre-halves looking uncomfortable, and only a well placed shin blocks a dangerous run into the box from the left wing. Mercifully, on 56 minutes, Djurgården pick up a second goal. Again, it’s from a corner. This time an attacker gets his head to the ball first on the back post, though without sufficient power to score. A messy goalmouth scramble ends with a decisive touch from veteran defender Markus Johannesson — a nice way to end his final season at the club.\nRelief in Stockholm is tempered by bad news from Gothenburg. AIK have equalised, putting them back on top of the pile. Göteborg need a win to take the title.\nI try, through the match, to pick up terrace songs. The tunes are easy enough, as even these seem to be a part of the globalised game. We sing ‘Na, na, na, …, Djurgården’ to the tune of Hey Jude, and an amusing ‘Steve Galloways Jarnkaminerna’ to the ‘Barmy Army’ tune — Steve Galloway being their English assistant manager (he played at St. Mirren and Crystal Palace, apparently) and ‘Jarnkaminerna’ (‘The Iron Stoves’) the fan club. If I close my eyes, I could easily be at Rochdale or York City, but for the lack of dietary advice directed at the away goalkeeper. I find the chants a little disappointing in their politeness, to be honest. One promisingly aggressive call-and-response from the left stand to the right turns out to be ‘Let’s move forward!’, ‘But keep the defence tight!’, ‘Let’s move forward!’, ‘But keep the defence tight!’. That’s just practical. Can’t we at least discuss their striker’s parentage briefly? After the second goal, Kalmar lose some of their fight and the game goes a bit quiet. Apart from trying to follow songs, the best entertainment arrives when the Djurgården goalkeeper slices four goal kicks in a row high into the left stand. Only one goes further than the half way line. Four in a row! I hope he has somewhere to practice over the winter when the snow sets deep.\nThe relief of getting their win is clear in the players’ celebrations at the final whistle, lapping the pitch to thank their support. Still waiting for results around the country, the disappointing news arrives: AIK have scored a late winner to confirm they’ll be bringing the Allsvenskan trophy back to parade around Stockholm. And there’ll likely be more riots in Gothenburg for Jens Lekman to sing about.\nSo then, Göteborg didn’t manage to stop AIK but Djurgården did what they needed to do. Most importantly, I care about a club here. I’m looking forward to next season already."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A common task of scientific projects is creating plots and tables to visualise data and adding these plots and tables to some output document, for example a paper, thesis or slide deck. In a typical workflow, we might have some input data which is processed by Python scripts and output in image files. These images are then referenced in a TeX file to be rendered as a PDF.\nWhen you start working on projects like this, all of these steps will likely be manual. What happens if the data is updated? You have to re-run the plot scripts, remembering the right commands to run and subtleties of the environment in which they will run successfully. Then you manually save the plots into a folder. Then you manually copy them into another folder to be referenced from the TeX file. Then you manually re-run the TeX renderer. All these manual steps multiply the potential for errors and for reproducibility to be broken if you forget to document every step exactly. This is where someone comes to you six months later because they can’t reproduce the output and you say ‘Oh, I forgot to say this package has to be installed’ or ‘Oh, I forgot to say you need x added to the y environment variable for that to work.’ And that someone in six months is most likely to be you.\nWe solve this by writing the steps down exactly. The most well-used tool for this kind of thing is make. You might think of make as a tool for building code, but really it is a tool for expressing dependencies of files — it is perfect for automating tasks like this.1 I’m going to illustrate how I typically do this kind of thing in a demo project with a Makefile and I’ll go through the steps here. The demo project is on GitHub, including the rendered outputs. The particular dataset and analysis here is not important, it’s just to have something to demo. We’re looking at Transport for London’s cycle hire usage data aggregated in this Kaggle dataset."

    "section": "Another Plot, Another Planet",
    "text": "Another Plot, Another Planet\nThe plots we’re going to produce in this project are written as Python scripts using matplotlib. We’ll put all plot scripts in a src/plots folder. In there, every plot script is prefixed with plot_. In our demo project we have\nsrc/plots/\n    +--plot_daily_journeys.py\n    +--plot_trips_vs_temp.py\nI strongly recommend you have one script for every one plot you want to show in the final outputs. Even if the script is exactly the same apart from a parameter or two. This will often mean a lot of repeat code, which you would usually want to avoid by abstraction. Resist the urge! In data visualisation you want to tailor each plot precisely, even if it’s just something like the location of a legend or some axis ticks. One script, one plot.\nThe plot scripts all get boilerplate code at the top to parse arguments we’re going to pass in at the command line.\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Plotting script.\")\nparser.add_argument('--pdf', default=False, action=\"store_true\",\n    help=\"Output PDF file.\")\nparser.add_argument('--png', default=False, action=\"store_true\",\n    help=\"Output PNG file.\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--show\", default=False, action=\"store_true\",\n    help=\"Show plot in GUI.\")\nopts, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()\nprint('opts:', opts)\nThey get matching boilerplate at the bottom to output based on those arguments.\n# Get the filename of this script without extension.\npath_no_ext = os.path.splitext(sys.argv[0])[0]\nif opts.pdf:\n    plt.savefig(path_no_ext + '.pdf')\nif opts.png:\n    plt.savefig(path_no_ext + '.png')\nif opts.show:\n    plt.show()\nSo for example the command python src/plots/plot_daily_journeys.py --pdf --show will both write the output plot to src/plots/plot_daily_journeys.pdf and show the plot in a GUI window for you to check.\nIn this demo, we have two plots. First, plot_daily_journeys.py plots the average number of weekday bike trips by hour of the day, in wet and dry weather. Do more people cycle when it’s dry? When in the day do they hire bikes?\n\n\n\n\nOutput from plot_daily_journeys.py.\n\n\n\nAnd second, plot_trips_vs_temp.py plots the number of cycle trips between 08:00 and 09:00 for each weekday in the period the data was collected, vs the feels-like temperature at the time. Do more people hire bikes when it feels warmer?\n\n\n\n\nOutput from plot_trips_vs_temp.py.\n\n\n\nNow we’ll look at how we automate this in the Makefile. First we set the plots directory as a variable.\nPLOTS_DIR = src/plots/\nNext we specify that all of the plot scripts are of the form plot_*.py, and that the matching outputs are plot_*.png for PNG files and plot_*.pdf for PDFs.2\nPLOTS_PY = $(wildcard $(PLOTS_DIR)plot_*.py)\nPLOTS_PDF = $(PLOTS_PY:.py=.pdf)\nPLOTS_PNG = $(PLOTS_PY:.py=.png)\nNow we need to tell make the recipe that turns .py files in to .png and .pdf files.\n$(PLOTS_DIR)%.pdf: $(PLOTS_DIR)%.py \n    python $&lt; --pdf $(PLOTS_FLAGS)\n\n$(PLOTS_DIR)%.png: $(PLOTS_DIR)%.py \n    python $&lt; --png $(PLOTS_FLAGS)\n\n\nHere $&lt; is an automatic variable that takes the name of the first prerequisite, in this case the python script.\nThe variable PLOTS_FLAGS contains any extra flags we want to pass to every plotting script. We’ll look at that later. Now we add recipes to produce all the plots.\nplots_pdf: $(PLOTS_PDF)\nplots_png: $(PLOTS_PNG)\nplots: plots_pdf plots_png\nSo then make plots_pdf will output all of the plot PDFs and make plots will output all formats. Note that make checks modified timestamps for dependencies and only updates what it needs to, so if you update only one script only that one will be re-run."

    "text": "Today I reached a milestone. I’m ten thousand days old.1 This curiously comfortable planet has spun around 10⁴ times since I joined the party. For reference, less excitingly, that’s been 27 years, 4 months and 16 days.\nI feel some significance in this, more than birthdays I’ve passed. I think it’s because a day is such a useful little unit of life. You can make something wonderful — something that changes everything — out of a day. Its just long enough. At the same time, its short enough that if one gets messed up, by circumstance or idleness, the next one is coming right along with all that opportunity restored. Years get hazy but 10,000 days — that’s serious time!\nAccording to Malcolm Gladwell, if I’d spent just one hour of each of those days practicing a thing, I’d be an expert at it by now.2 I’m no expert at anything. What have I been doing? To ward off useless nostalgia, I felt I should mark this big round decimal with a reflection, that I should find some dusty trinket of wisdom to share from the attic of my brain. It turns out there wasn’t much up there.\nOne thing swirling around my head now though is a lovely and impelling sentence I read some time ago in The Age of Wonder by Richard Holmes. It’s from a letter written by a young John Herschel to his friend and fellow maths student, Charles Babbage.\nIt’s obvious perhaps, but what a lyrical expression of that feeling — that ardent wish to use time more wisely, and that envy of those who do. ‘Every atom of time’ is precise and tidy, and that verb fits snugly. My dictionary here tells me here that ‘to husband’ comes from the Old Norse,\nDiscarding the gender baggage of our more common use of the word, isn’t that precisely what we would like to do with time? Not just to occupy it but to cultivate it, to till it like soil? So from the heart of Herschel’s line, the phrase that stuck with me is the imperative: husband every atom of time.\nHow well have I cultivated the 10,000 days to this juncture? Well, I’ve tilled some soil. I’ve spent days making and doing things I’m proud of and, most important of all, I’ve been lucky to share many of them with people I love dearly. But I’ve also wasted plenty of time — entire days even — through distraction, forgetting what it is I want to be and who I want to spend my time with. Something I have learnt by now is how dreadful, how horrific it is to waste time — mine or anyone else’s.\nSo that’s what I say to myself here as I feel myself being distracted by the noise of the world again: Husband every atom of time. Till the soil. If I can expand toward ‘that enviable capacity’, I’ve got a good chance of still being friends with myself when I hit 20,000. 23 January, 2038. I’ll make a note of it."

If g(\\mathbf{X}) is continuous and sufficiently differentiable we can in the same way expand a Taylor series around \\mu_\\mathbf{X}, the mean of \\mathbf{X}, and write \\begin{equation}\n  g(X) = g(\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) + \\nabla g(\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) (\\mathbf{X}\n    - \\mu_\\mathbf{X}) + \\tfrac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{X} - \\mu_\\mathbf{X})^T H_g\n    (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) (\\mathbf{X} - \\mu_\\mathbf{X}) + \\mathcal{O}((\\mathbf{X} -\n    \\mu_\\mathbf{X})^3)\n\\end{equation} where H_g is the Hessian of g.\nIf the moments of each element of \\mathbf{X} are finite, we may approximate the expectation of the function as2 \\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{E}(g(\\mathbf{X})) \\approx g(\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) +\n   \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathrm{Tr}\n   \\left[ H_f (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\Sigma_\\mathbf{X} \\right]\n\\end{equation} where \\Sigma_\\mathbf{X} is the covariance matrix of \\mathbf{X}.\nFor example, if n = 2 such that \n\\mathbf{X} = \\left[ \\begin{smallmatrix} X_1\n\\\\ X_2 \\end{smallmatrix} \\right]\n, we have a Hessian\n\nH_g (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_1\n     \\partial X_2} \\\\\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_2\n     \\partial X_1}                     & \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_2^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n(\\mu_\\mathbf{X})\n\nand a covariance matrix\n\n\\Sigma_\\mathbf{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n   \\sigma_{X_1}^2          & \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) \\\\\n   \\mathrm{Cov}(X_2, X_1)  & \\sigma_{X_2}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nThen we can expand the trace, \n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Tr} \\left[ H_g (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\Sigma_\\mathbf{X} \\right] =\n&\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_1^2} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\sigma_{X_1}^2 +\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_1\n\\partial X_2} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\mathrm{Cov}(X_2, X_1) + \\\\\n&\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_2\n\\partial X_1} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) +\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_2^2} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\sigma_{X_2}^2.\n\\end{split}\n\nIf X_1, X_2 are independent such that \\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(X_2, X_1) = 0, we are left with a second order approximation for the expected value of the multivariate function, \\begin{equation}\n   \\mathbb{E}(g(\\mathbf{X})) \\approx g(\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) +\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_1^2} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\sigma_{X_1}^2 +\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial X_2^2} (\\mu_\\mathbf{X}) \\sigma_{X_2}^2.\n\\end{equation}"
