1. [_Himalaya_][bs-himalaya] by Michael Palin --- Palin crosses the Himalayas:
   Pakistan, Nepal and Everest Base Camp, Tibet, India, Bhutan.

2. [_10:04_][bs-1004] by Ben Lerner --- One from my old New York list, read
    quickly but didn't grab me.

3. [_Deep Work_][bs-dw] by Cal Newport {% include reread.html %} --- A great one
    to come back to and I think Newport's best.

4. [_Cat’s Cradle_][bs-cc] by Kurt Vonnegut --- I never have much I want to say
    about Vonnegut books except I love them and you should read them.

5. [_No Country for Old Men_][bs-ncfom] by Cormac McCarthy --- The Coen
    Brothers' adaptation might be my favourite film, I've watched it so many
    times. The film stays close to the book.

6. [_Solar_][bs-solar] by Ian McEwan --- Hard to read such a hateful protagonist
    but funny in parts with some physics nods to keep me interested.

7. [_Maigret’s Patience (Maigret #64)_][bs-mp] by Georges Simenon --- Grabbing
    something to read I went way out of order with the Maigrets.

8. [_A Man’s Head (Maigret #9)_][bs-mh] by Georges Simenon ---  Back in order.
    Maigret helps a convicted murderer to escape. Trust in Maigret.

9. [_The Glorious Cause_][bs-gc] by Robert Middlekauff --- I have a slow goal to
    read all of the _Oxford History of the United States_, I enjoy the grand
    idea of it. If it's even completed in my lifetime. This first volume was
    published in 1982, on the American Revolution, 1763--1789.

10. [_God Save Texas_][bs-gst] by Lawrence Wright --- California (54 votes) and
    Texas (40) dominate the Electral College, but Texas is growing.

    > Because Texas is a part of almost everything in modern America --- the
    > South, the West, the Plains, Hispanic and immigrant communities, the
    > border, the divide between the rural areas and the cities --- what happens
    > here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation.

    A few years ago a friend moved to Lubbock and another moved to Houston for
    postdocs so I planned a roadtrip across Texas to visit both. Other things
    got in the way and I regret not doing it.

11. [_The Runner_][bs-run] by Markus Torgeby --- Escaping the world to live in
    the forests of northern Sweden and run every day. What's not to love.

12. [_Manchester Happened_][bs-manc] by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi --- A short
    story collection about Ugandans who move to Britain, specifically to
    Manchester, and about British Ugandans returning to Kampala. Obviously I
    enjoyed the references to the city, like a wait at the bus stop outside Kro
    on Oxford Road, a scene I know well. Makumbi's range of characters explores
    some of the variance in people's experience of migration, even to the same
    place. I'd say _Christmas is Coming_ is best.

13. [_The Dancer at the Gia-Moulin_][bs-dgm] by Georges Simonen (Maigret #10)
    --- this one's in Liège, and where is Maigret? He'll be there, don't worry.

14. [_The Wire_][bs-wire] by Rafael Alvarez --- Alvarez was a staff writer on
    _The Wire_, brought in by David Simon for the second season because he'd
    worked the Balitmore docks for the _Seafarers International Union_ as well
    as the _Baltimore Sun_. 
    
    What you see in this guide is how much David Simon and Ed Burns are telling
    the stories of the city they know. Melvin Williams was a drug trafficker in
    the 70s sentenced to decades in prison. Burns was one of the detectives on
    the case, Simon covered it and profiled Williams for the _Baltimore Sun_. He
    was the inspiration for Avon Barkesdale. After his release from prison after
    season one, Williams joined the cast of the show: he's the Deacon.
    
15. [_World Order_][bs-wo] by Henry Kissinger --- A survey of Kissinger's
    perspective on the history of geopolitics.

16. [_The Perfect Spy_][bs-ps] by John le Carré --- I didn't enjoy as much as
    some of the Smiley ones, a bit psychological for me but still great.

17. [_Cannery Row_][bs-cr] by John Steinbeck --- In Monterey, California, Mack
    and the boys are pushed to the edge of society (and town) but still have a
    plan to make something happen.

18. [_The Best We Could Do_][bs-bwcd] by Thi Bui {% include star.html %} ---
    This graphic memoir starts at the end with Bui's new motherhood and
    navigates from there her relationships with her own parents and siblings,
    telling their story of life in South Vietnam, colonialism and war, dangerous
    escape by boat, asylum in the United States and experience as Vietnamese
    Americans.

19. [_Full Circle_][bs-fc] by Michael Palin --- an anticlockwise traversal of
    the Pacific Rim.

20. [_The Power of Geography_][bs-pg] by Tim Marshall --- A sequel to _Prisoners
    of Geography_, with a shift of focus from geography's impact on historical
    events to now and the near future. I was reading the chapter on Australia,
    and how its military priority will always be the need for a strong naval
    force, as news of the AUKUS alliance broke.[^aus]

    The chapters on Iran and Saudi Arabia can be read together as a battle
    for influence over a region, likewise Greece and Turkey.    

21. [_A Visit from the Goon Squad_][bs-gs] by Jennifer Egan --- Time's a goon.
    These linked stories around the music industry were written at the time of
    mass pirated MP3s and before the rise of Spotify and the vinyl revival so
    there's a negative outlook written in.

22. [_The Story of China_][bs-china] by Michael Wood {% include star.html %} ---
    The innovation in the Song dynasty up to the 1200s, compared with Europe at
    the time, is unparalleled. Public opinion in Britain was largely against the
    Opium wars.

23. [_Believe Us_][bs-believe] by Melissa Reddy --- Detail and insider views on
    Jürgen Klopp's title-winning machine.

24. [_In Search of the Canary Tree_][bs-canary] by Lauren E. Oakes --- A
    snapshot of climate change in its destructive effect on yellow cedar trees
    on an archipelago off Alaska.

25. [_The Places In Between_][bs-between] by Rory Stewart --- Given that the
    options for British Prime Minister are mostly men who went to Eton, it's a
    shame we didn't get the one who survived a few hundred miles across
    Afganistan's high mountain passes in winter during a war. He gets by
    speaking Dari, relying on hospitality and carrying a relay of letters of
    approval from village to village, hopefully from from the right warlord. He
    might have had a better go at a pandemic anyway.

26. [_The Man from the Future_][bs-future] by Ananyo Bhattacharya {% include
    star.html %} --- The [Manchester Baby][baby][^mbaby] is generally recognised
    as the first electronic stored program computer but Bhattacharya makes the
    case that Klára von Neumann's earlier program for the ENIAC could be
    considered stored. It strikes me how much of my own career so far has been
    based on the application of innovations John von Neumann made in quantum
    physics, Monte Carlo methods, game theory, and on. This year I wrote an
    internal research paper on a method based on payoffs in cooperative game
    theory, extended from von Neumann's invention by Shapley and described in
    this book.

[^aus]: Suprising to me: Beijing is closer to Dublin (~8,300 km) than it is to
    Canberra (~9,000 km). Thanks again, Mercator projection.

[^mbaby]: A replica of Baby sits in _MoSI_.
