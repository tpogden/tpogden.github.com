<p>The United States is a welcoming place. This I knew from previous visits to
the New World. Apart from the time they served me something called
&lsquo;Biscuits and Gravy&rsquo; for breakfast, which turned out to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuits_and_gravy"> contain neither
biscuits nor gravy</a>, I&rsquo;ve always found
Americans to be perfect hosts.

What I wasn&rsquo;t expecting was that, on our first trip to Washington,
me and Livy would get to step into the Oval Office. The actual one. With the
desk and the rug and the president and everything. Well, we had to wait until
Barack Obama had finished work for the day until we could nose about his place
of work, but fair enough.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been as excited about being somewhere in my
life. We were asked not to take photos in the West Wing so I donâ€™t have anything
from there to show, but at the time that just made me more determined to get
every photon I could into my eyeballs as we pottered around to gaze at the Navy
Mess, the Cabinet Room, the Roosevelt Room. And then that room with no
corners.</p>

<p>The Marine stationed at the door kindly offered that we take one step inside,
and I knew better than to ask for a second. From there I tried my best to
imprint the image on my retinas &mdash; the busts of Martin Luther King and
Lincoln, the two pastoral Edward Hoppers behind that hunk of wood from the HMS
Resolute saved from the Arctic ice.</p>

<p>We were allowed to take photos in the Press Briefing Room (obviously I <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9YV8IdxoCH/">pretended I was C.J. Cregg</a>)
and outside the building, so here&rsquo;s a view of the Residence and North
Portico from outside the West Colonnade.</p>

<p>
During our time in what must be eighteen of the highest-security acres on the
planet, we were also invited to walk around the Eisenhower Executive Office
Building which sits next door and houses most of the administration staff
in its 500-odd offices.

<p> The corridors and staircases of the Eisenhower building are superior to
those of the West Wing, which have low ceilings and functional carpets.
It&rsquo;s hard to comprehend that the Eisenhower building was long unloved.
Mark Twain declared it &lsquo;the ugliest building in America.&rsquo; I guess
he hadn&rsquo;t seen Trump Tower. Having swerved a planned demolition in 1957 to
save on maintenance costs, it&rsquo;s now a National Historic Landmark, so
should be safe.

</p>

<p>That's all I&rsquo;ve got from the White House. If the people who made that 
possible happen to read this &mdash; thank you.</p>

<p>Of course we also popped into some of the amazing Smithsonian National
Museums around the Mall: of American History, of Natural History, of the
American Indian, of Air and Space, and the National Gallery of Art.</p>


<p>There are too many wonderful exhibits to list, but I would say
Charles Lindbergh&rsquo;s <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em>, the Apollo 11 Command
Module, the Star-Spangled Banner, Doug Engelbart&rsquo;s first prototype mouse
and Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s <a

:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_(719161).jpg">blue, blue
self-portrait</a> stand out as memorable things to stand close to.</p>

visited the amazing museums, including the various Smithsonians, Air and

<p>Both Livy and me particularly enjoyed the Newseum, which features exhibits on
the history of journalism, the First Amendment and the technological history of
media. A poignant memorial lists the many names of correspondents and
photographers killed in the course of their reporting, updated every year.</p>

<p>The balcony offers great views along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to
the White House.</p>

<p>We stayed with friends in the Bloomingdale neighbourhood to the
north of the Capitol Building (which usefully marks the origin of the
city&rsquo;s grid system). The street presents these beautiful
Victorian-style rowhouses, which feature on the <em>House of Cards</em> intro if
you look close.

<p>And that was the District of Columbia. From Union Station we took the Amtrak
back north through Baltimore to New York.</p>

<p><em>It's not the greenery turning gold in fall,
the scenery circling the Mall&hellip;</em></p>
