1. _Sapiens_ by Yuval Noah Harari --- A wide-lens look at
   human history, particularly at biology and culture. One of the most
   interesting arguments is that the agricultural revolution promoted huge
   population growth, and was thus successful for the species, but made the
   lives of individual _homo sapiens_ worse than when they had been hunter
   gatherers. The same claim may be made for the industrial revolution. Once
   such an upheaval has happened there's no way back.
 
2. _Rolling Blackouts_ by Sarah Glidden --- Two youngish
   American journalists tour Turkey, Syria and Iraq, looking for stories.
   Glidden, the author and cartoonist of this graphic novel, tags along to
   document the trip. So does another friend, a former US marine who served in
   Iraq and has his own view on things. It’s poignant to read the stories of
   Iraqi families who found refuge in Syria, realising that in the time since
   this was written their lives have no doubt been in danger and turmoil all
   over again.
 
3. _Silence_ by Erling Kagge --- Not a deep read, but
   reminded me that one of the great benefits of long distance running or
   walking is spending time in your own head.
 
4. _Everything and More_ by David Foster Wallace --- A
   history of infinity, in particular the work of Georg Cantor. Wallace tries to
   cut down on the amount of repetition in mathematical writing with a lot of
   abbreviations, but I found this slowed down the reading rather than help. The
   book claims to be readable without some background in maths. As in the case
   of Penrose’s _The Road to Reality_ I think even if that were true it would
   not be a fun read. If you've studied some mathematical foundations, I
   recommend.
 
5. _Seveneves_ by Neal Stephenson --- I’ve long thought if I
   ever got into sci-fi, I’d get into it hard. This might be the book to do it.
   Saying that, the first two of the three parts are the ones I really enjoyed
   and they’re the ones that are set in the near future with some nice thinking
   about orbital mechanics. The third part, the real sci-fi bit, took a while
   for me to see the point of.
 
6. _Janesville_ by Amy Goldstein ★ --- The modern history of one industrial city in Wisconsin. Janesville was
    the home of the Parker pen company and had the oldest General Motors factory
    in the US until it closed in 2008. The book follows a few of the residents
    affected by the plant closure over the following five years. These
    characters make concrete the problems of deindustrialisation: how tough it
    to lose the job you thought would be for life, how tough it is to retrain,
    to commute huge distances or move when property prices plummet.

7. _12 Rules for Life_ by Jordan B. Peterson --- Like any
   self-help book, there’s some obvious stuff here that could be useful.
   Useful to me maybe. "Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for
   helping”, sure. Society is full of Pareto distributions, sure. Be ready for a lot of 
   Old Testament. Among the weirdness, there's a bit where his example of good 
   parenting is his ability to pin down a two year old.

8. _Daniels' Running Formula_ by Jack Daniels --- Training
   plans from 800m to marathon with useful details on physiology, nutrition and
   recovering from injuries. The latter became the most important chapter this
   time as I got crocked halfway through a marathon programme.

9. _October_ by China Miéville --- A narrative look at the
   Russian Revolution between February and October 1917. There’s a lot of
   bureaucracy that is key to the story (so many committees) and it’s hard to
   make that interesting even for a storyteller like Miéville. His own politics
   must be considered, including admiration of Lenin, but he’s open about it.

10. _Aurora_ by Melanie Windridge --- This is a combination
    of a travelogue around Canada, Iceland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway (northern
    parts of the world where the auroral oval can be seen) and a pop science
    explainer. Windridge is a plasma physicist and does the explaining well. I
    thought I roughly understood the mechanism: solar wind hits magnetosphere,
    solar wind particles excited. I was close but wrong. 

    Here’s how I understand it after reading the book. Solar wind is plasma with
    a frozen-in magnetic field. The direction of the field can be pointing north
    or south as the sun spins and blasts out coronal mass ejections. When the
    solar wind hits the magnetosphere, the plasma is diverted around the Earth,
    and its frozen-in magnetic field is draped around the magnetosphere. There’s
    a clustering of field lines on the upstream (sun-side) of Earth, 60,000 km
    above the equator. If fields pointing in opposite directions are pushed
    close enough together, the  field plasma can break down and the magnetic
    configuration can change: field lines break and reconnect. There’s tension
    in the plasma, and the reconnection catapults plasma particles away and down
    the field lines. Energy is transferred from the field to the particles as
    they are accelerated to high speed. The particles collide with the upper
    atmosphere and its the atmospheric particles that are excited. So the aurora
    happens at the bottom of the field lines.

    I also learnt which transitions cause the different colours of the aurora
    and why they’re banded by height. Greens and reds are both transitions of
    oxygen. The decay lifetime of the green excitation is around a second, the
    red excitation lifetime is about two minutes. If there’s a collision with
    another molecule before the excited molecule has time to decay, the energy
    will be lost as heat and there won’t be colour emission. So the green
    transition is more common than the red. Also the red aurora tends to appear
    above 200 km (where there are fewer molecules to bump into) and the green
    aurora are lower at around 150 km. Pink and purple colours are due to
    transitions of nitrogen that have much shorter decay times and can be seen
    below 100 km.

11. _A Small Town in Germany_ by John le Carré --- I’ve been
    meaning to try a le Carré book for a while, and was immediately hooked on
    this one. Something between a spy novel and a mystery set in Bonn in the
    60s.

12. _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ by Cal Newport ★ --- 'Follow your passion' is terrible advice.

13. _Empire_ by Stephen Howe --- Howe splits empires into
    those on land and those of sea. Land empires being those that grew by
    overland expansion, extending frontiers, like the Roman or the Ottoman. We
    maybe don’t even think of the ones that still exist as being empires, like
    the Russian, Chinese or American. The sea power empires are the European
    kind of the last 500 years, the ones that really spread over the globe. The
    book mostly focusses on these, the impact and aftermath of that imperialism.

    > The economic balance sheet of colonialism, for both imperialist and
    > colonized countries, presents a hugely complex, mixed record: one over
    > which economic historians have long disputed, and will continue to do so.
    > […] In some, indeed, all the preconditions for future commercial and
    > industrial dynamism were present, as in India with its huge production of
    > textiles. Colonial rule destroyed these conditions where they existed, and
    > blocked the possibility of their emerging elsewhere. Colonized areas were
    > forced into acting as sources of underpriced raw materials for European
    > industry and of cheap, often forced or enslaved, labour. They were not
    > allowed to develop industries of their own, except in the few cases where
    > this suited European needs.
 
14. _How to Be Miserable_ by Randy J. Paterson --- I picked
    this up after watching [CGP Grey’s short video][grey], which I bet sold a
    lot of copies. Here’s Grey:
 
    > Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon
    > which you sail. Last, but most important, follow your instincts.
    > Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy, for there is a
    > dark magnetic field that  points the compass of your impulses in the right
    > direction once you get started. You will want to stay indoors, you will
    > want to not exercise, you will want to sleep in, you will want to do what
    > you know will make you sadder after you've done it.
 
15. _The Bridge_ by Geert Mak --- The fifth, current,
    [Galata Bridge][galata] is not architecturally interesting but its location
    and history are remarkable. And the memory of [walking over it][istanbul]
    has stuck with me: a city of its own with its fishermen, street sellers,
    pickpockets and hustlers.

    Orhan Pamuk writes of the bridge in _The Museum of Innocence_ but I wondered
    who else had. The reason this book is a great read is that Mak spent the
    time to get the stories of the characters who make the bridge home and
    passes these stories on with empathy.
 
16. _Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race_ by Reni Eddo-Lodge {%
    include dash.html %} Eddo-Lodge [says the title of this book comes
    from][eddo] 
    
    > The gulf of an emotional disconnect that white people display when a
    person of colour articulates their experience. You can see their eyes shut
    down and harden. It’s like treacle is poured into their ears, blocking up
    their ear canals. It’s like they can no longer hear us.

    There were plenty of times reading the book I felt that disconnect, felt the
    awkwardness of having to think about how that experience differs from mine.
    I spend close to zero time thinking about what it means to be white.
    Recommended.
 
17. _Call for the Dead_ by John Le Carré --- After _A Small
    Town in Germany_ I went back to the first of the Smiley novels.
 
18. _A Murder of Quality_ by John Le Carré --- The second
    Smiley novel is a murder thriller.
 
19. _The Spy Who Came In from the Cold_ by John Le Carré --- The third Smiley novel is 
    back to espionage and to East Germany. OK, this one is really great. 

20. _The Mixer_ by Michael Cox --- A history of the Premier
    League in tactics, this starts by emphasising how much the back pass rule
    changed football. It stopped teams (notably Liverpool) using the back pass
    to kill games off when ahead. Defenders had to improve technically and
    goalkeepers had to become footballers. More exciting, especially on
    television.

    Cantona changes forward play, after which every team wants a foreign,
    mercurial number 10. Most are forgettable but then there’s Zola and
    Bergkamp. Arsené Wenger arrives, asking his chairman if fans would tolerate
    two foreign players in the team. Then the sprinter-finishers, Owen and
    Anelka. Reacting, clubs now need defenders to be fast too. Vialli lines up a
    Chelsea team with no British players.

    English tactics still lag European leagues, but Alex Ferguson picks it up as
    United get better in the Champions league. He not only built different
    champion teams but also derived at least three entirely different strategies
    to get ahead of the league. Arsené built the Invincibles. Later, Mourinho
    and Benitez, similar in background and in their reactive play, study hours
    of video and adapt each game to target opponents’ weaknesses. Their
    introduction in the same season lowered scoring rates in the league. Then
    possession football, false nines, inverted wingers and assisters. Finally
    the pressers, Pochettino and Klopp. Defenders had to attack, now attackers
    have to defend.

    Football is never still. As soon as a winning strategy emerges,
    counterstrategies arrive to beat it. They usually arrive from abroad. I read
    this during the World Cup. The combination might be enough to get me
    interested in football again after years of only paying attention to the
    Reds.

21. _Enlightenment Now_ by Steven Pinker --- The world is getting worse. Things were 
    better in the past. The current order is broken and corrupt. A revolution is 
    required. If people are hurt in that revolution, it’s for the greater ideological 
    good. Facts are not facts. Wading through the daily swamp of Brexit, Trumpism and 
    Corbynism, modern populism can sound a lot like apocalyptic religion.

    Pinker makes a restatement of the case for the Enlightenment values of
    reason, science and humanism. In the first part he takes measures of human
    wellbeing (health, wealth, safety, the environment, peace, equal rights,
    etc.) a chapter at a time and looks at long term positive trends. Where I do
    not follow Pinker’s optimism is climate change. He doesn’t look closely
    enough at how and why the opportunity to decarbonise energy early was
    missed. The result is already disastrous and may well be catastrophic.

22. _The Looking Glass War_ by John Le Carré --- Up to the
    fourth Smiley novel now. Le Carre's world of Cold War espionage is dark,
    messy and psychological. His spies are not just fallible but self-interested
    and often mediocre. Good plot.

23. _Hackers and Painters_ by Paul Graham --- Graham is the
    co-founder of [Y Combinator][yc]. This collection of essays are from his
    blog so I’ve read some of them before. Some interesting examples are [Why
    Nerds are Unpopular][pg-nerds], [The Hundred Year Language][pg-100y] and
    [How to Make Wealth][pg-wealth]. The writing is good and editing tight, but
    they're mostly humourless. The ones on programming langauges are best. For a
    rebuttal to [the title essay][pg-hp], see that other programmer, painter and
    solid writer [Maciej Cegłowski][dabblers]. 
    
24. _Triumph of the City_ by Edward L. Glaeser ★ --- I've lived most of my adult life 
    in the centre of
    cities, not by accident. Harvard urban economist Edward Glaeser here makes
    the case for urban life. First, on the agglomeration effects that have made
    cities hubs of productivity through history.

    > Silicon Valley and Bangalore remind us that electronic interaction won’t
    make fact-to-face contact obsolete. The computer industry, more than any
    other sector, is the place where one might expect remote communication to
    replace person-to-person meetings.

    There's a chapter that looks at the decline of industrial cities, with an
    interesting observation on what made those cities vulnerable.

    > The industrial town was unlike either those old commercial cities or the
    modern capitals of the information age. Its vast factories employed hundreds
    of thousands of relatively unskilled workers. Those factories were
    self-sufficient and isolated from the world outside, except that they were
    providing the planet with vast quantities of cheap, identical products.

    Some cities have tried to build themselves back to success, which Glaeser
    argues is getting things the wrong way around. In fact, bulldozing might be
    a better, if unpopular, strategy.

    > Leipzig is worthy of emulation less for its cultural strategy than for its
    hard headed policy of accepting decline and reducing the empty housing
    stock. In 2000, one fifth of the city’s homes stock was vacant, a total of
    62,500 homes. Bulldozing vacant homes reduces the cost of city services,
    eliminates safety hazards, and turns decaying eyesores into usable space.
    Leipzig set a target of destroying 20,000 vacant units.

    The visibility of poverty in cities can give people the idea cities _cause_
    poverty but this is [wet streets cause rain][wscr] thinking.

    > Cities can be places of great inequality; they attract some of the world’s
    richest and poorest people. Although poverty can accompany urban decline,
    poverty often shows that a city is functioning well. Cities attract poor
    people because they’re good places for poor people to live.

    Maybe we should be more concerned about the cities where we don't see
    poverty.

    > The absence of poor people in an area is a signal that it lacks something
    important, like affordable housing or public transportation or jobs for the
    least skilled.

    Living in a city is far better for the environment than living in the
    countryside. I've learnt that people are surprised when you tell them this
    and can get offended if they have moved out to a shire and think they're
    saving the planet because they drive once a month to an organic farmers'
    market in a diesel.

    What makes a succesful city? The book concludes with the standout example of
    Singapore, which provides a high quality of life and plenty of wealth for
    its citizens without having much in the way of natural resources. The
    drivers are a remarkably competent public sector and decades-long focus on
    education.

    > Education is, after January temperature, the most reliable predictor of
    urban growth.

25. _Energy_ by Richard Rhodes --- An ambitious and detailed
    trip through 400 years of human energy production from wood burning through
    coal, oil, petrol, nuclear and renewable energy sources, looking at
    innovation and the impact on society and the environment.

    There are some great historical notes. I thought I knew well the story of
    Stephenson's first passenger railway from here in Manchester to Liverpool,
    but there is good detail on the ingenuity of floating the tracks over the
    swamp of Chat Moss and the invested interests Stephenson fought, from canal
    owners, carriage companies and wealthy landowners. The Earl of Sefton sent
    secret death threats, letting Stephenson know he'd have him thrown in a lake
    if he persisted in taking the railway through Sefton's estates.
 
26. _A Walk in the Woods_ by Bill Bryson --- I read a bunch
    of Bryson's travel books [in 2015][2015] but put this one off partly because
    I knew it'd just put in my head the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail
    and that's not a small thing to have in your head. It's about 3,500 km long,
    it'd take months. Anyway, now I want to walk the Appalachian Trail.

27. _Worth Dying For_ by Tim Marshall --- A world tour of
    national flags, and some others. There’s a bit of history on each and some
    interesting facts, like the eight places the Stars and Stripes is authorised
    to fly 24 hours a day, how Nato HQ rotates its flags every Sunday, and that
    the night sky shown in the Brazil flag is just as it would have been
    observed in Rio de Janeiro on 15 November 1889 at the time the monarchy was
    taken down.

    There’s brief mentions of how flags are used to unite and divide, including
    how the St George’s Cross gets co-opted by the far right in Britain and why
    the Confederate flag is still flown in the Southern US. But mostly it’s an
    interesting light read.

    Favourite flags? [South Korea][flag-sk], [Barbados][flag-b],
    [Seychelles][flag-sey], [Brazil][flag-br], [Vietnam][flag-v]. And
    [Nepal][flag-n] because yeah, enough rectangles.

28. _Madness Visible_ by Janine di Giovanni ★ --- I made trips to Slovenia and Croatia 
    this year, both beautiful, modern EU states. I picked this up in a bookshop in 
    Dubrovnik: Di Giovanni's memoir of the Balkan Wars, which she covered on the ground 
    for _The Times_. It's a harrowing firsthand account of the devestating reality of 
    murder, torture and ethnic cleansing from Sarajevo, Kosovo, Pristina. Di Giovanni
    avoids political judgements, focusing on reporting war from the perspective
    of its victims.

    It's a reminder of the extreme danger faced by war correspondents.
    Subscribe to a newspaper that pays foreign correspondents or there'll be
    nobody there to report on such atrocities.
