<!-- 'He was as tough and romantic as the city he loved.' -->

<p>In October we took a trip to the mid-Atlantic cities of the United States:
New York City, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. First we spent a week staying
in an apartment on the Lower East Side. These photos are from Manhattan.</p>

A walk along the High Line from Chelsea Market to the Hudson Yards.

<p>The construction site here is the largest development ever in the United States.</p>

<p>We went to a few of the museums of course: the Guggenheim, MoMA and The Metropolitan. I
took early runs along the East River under the bridges.</p>

<p>We got to the Housing Works Bookstore and to McNally Jackson. Didn't make
it to Strand but hopefully next time.</p>

Your standard tourist skyscraper view of Gotham, of course. I think the viewing point 
from the balcony bar at the Met is better, perched above Central Park.

<p>I would recommend a tour of the building maintained at the Tenement Museum on
Orchard Street on the Lower East Side. Each floor is preserved at a different
decade in its history, and tells the story of the migrant families living there
at each point. It's a time capsule, boarded up in the 1930s and
untouched until the museum bought the building in 1988.</p>

<p>Livy was smart enough to book us tickets to go up to the crown in advance,
so we got to go up there.</p>
